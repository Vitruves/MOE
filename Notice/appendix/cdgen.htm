<div class="content">

<p>QuaSAR-CombiGen enumerates a virtual library of all possible products that
  are combinatorially generated from a set of fragment molecules contained in a
  scaffold database and a set of substituent R-group databases. The virtual
  library is constructed by functionalizing central molecular fragments called
  <i>scaffolds</i>. Both monodentate and bidentate as well as symmetric
  substitutions are supported, and substitution through higher-order bonds is
  also allowed.</p>

<p>QuaSAR-CombiGen has been superseded in MOE by the the <a href=
  "../apps/combitools.htm">Combinatorial Library</a> application.</p>

<p>QuaSAR-CombiGen is opened using <b><nobr>MOE | Compute | QuaSAR |
  QuaSAR-CombiGen</nobr></b> from the MOE Window.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> MOE also provides a non-enumerative (sampling) method for
  combinatorial library generation in <a href=

<h1>Representation of Combinatorial Libraries</h1>

<p>In MOE, a combinatorial library is specified by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A database of scaffold molecules or a single scaffold molecule</li>
    <li>Databases of functional groups</li>
    <li>Connection information specifying where the functional groups attach on
    each scaffold</li>
  </ul>
<a id="AttachPoints"></a>
<h3>Attachment Points</h3>

<p>A single combinatorial product is constructed by attaching <i>R-groups</i>
  to a scaffold at marked <i>attachment points</i>, called <i>ports</i>. The
  entire combinatorial library is enumerated by exhaustively cycling through
  all combinations of R-groups at every attachment point on every scaffold. The
  virtual library is written to an output database.</p>

<p>Attachment points are terminal atoms named &quot;A<i>n</i>&quot;, where
  <i>n</i> is a positive integer. In the QuaSAR-CombiGen panel, <i>n</i> is
  limited to the range [0..9]. When using the SVL command
  <tt>QuaSAR_CombiGen</tt>, however, <i>n</i> can be in the range [0..999]. If
  the terminal atom is attached to the main molecule by a higher-order bond,
  substitution will be made through a bond of the same order. Note that the
  bond order at the scaffold attachment point must agree with that at the
  R-group attachment point: either at least one of the bond orders must be 1
  (single bond), or both must be of the same order.</p>

<p>Fragment molecules are created by appropriately naming atoms at the
  desired points of substitution. You can use the <a href=
  "../moe/molsystems/build.htm">Builder</a> to perform this operation. You can
  also use the <a href="cliprg.htm">Clip R-Groups</a> application in a database
  to create fragments with named attachment points.</p>

<p>Attachment points must be specified on both the R-group and the scaffold
  molecule.
<a id="Scaffolds"></a>
</p>

<h3>Attachment Points on the Scaffold Molecule</h3>

<p>The scaffold molecule has one or more specially marked atoms that serve as
  attachment points for functional groups (R-groups).</p>
  <center>
    <img src="cdgen/combi_scaff.png" alt="Scaffold attachment points" /><br />
    <i>Scaffold with named attachment point atoms</i>
  </center>

<p>A scaffold molecule can have any number of attachment points. The
  attachment points need not be uniquely named; if two ports have the same
  name, they are functionalized simultaneously, resulting in a <i>symmetric
  substitution</i>.</p>
<a id="Fragments"></a>
<h3>Attachment Points on the R-Group Fragment Database</h3>
  <div class="floatright"><img src="cdgen/combi_rgroups.png" alt=
  "Scaffold attachment points" class="floatright" /></div>

<p>Every R-group has either one or two atoms that are marked as a point of
  attachment to the scaffold. <i>Monodentate</i> R-groups attach onto a
  scaffold through a single attachment point. <i>Bidentate</i> R-groups have
  two points of attachment to a scaffold.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>In a monodentate R-group database, the port name must be A0.</li>
    <li>In a bidentate R-group database, the ports must be named A0 and A1; all
    molecules in the database must have the two ports defined.</li>
  </ul>

<p>R-groups must contain exactly one A0 atom. Bidentate R-groups must further
  contain exactly one A1 atom.</p>

<p>The overall functionalization &quot;reaction&quot; is (in the monodentate
  case):</p>
  <div class="indent">
    <nobr>Scaffold-An + A0-R -&gt; Scaffold-R</nobr>
    <div class="indent">
      where <nobr>n = 0 to 9</nobr>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>That is, the marker atoms <i>An</i> (<i>n</i> is a digit) and <i>A0</i>
  are eliminated.</p>

<p>The bidentate case is analogous. In either case, the port atoms are
  destroyed.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> When bidentate R-groups are attached to a scaffold, there is
  an attempt to line up the corresponding attachment points with each other.
  This is achieved not only by rotating and translating the R-group, but also
  by scaling it. Consequently, the geometry of the R-group may be poor. You can
  use <nobr><b>DBV | Compute | Molecule | Energy Minimize</b></nobr> in a
  Database Viewer to obtain a lower energy conformation of the molecule.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Any fragment with an A0 port can be used as a monodentate
  R-group, and any fragment with both A0 and A1 ports can be used as a
  bidentate R-group; i.e. R-group molecules can contain unused ports.</p>
<a id="MultiRes"></a>
<h3>Multi-Residue Fragments</h3>

<p>Both the scaffold and the R-group may contain multiple chains and multiple
  residues.
<a id="Running"></a>
</p>

<h1>Running QuaSAR-CombiGen</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>In the MOE Window, start QuaSAR-CombiGen by choosing <nobr><b>MOE |
    Compute | QuaSAR | QuaSAR-CombiGen</b></nobr>. This opens the
    QuaSAR-CombiGen panel:
      <img src="cdgen/cdgen.png" alt="QuaSAR-CombiGen Panel" class="center" />
    </li>
    <li>In the <b>Output Database</b> field, enter the name of the database
    that will contain the results. This can be a new or an existing file. If it
    already exists, it will be overwritten (you will be asked to confirm the
    overwrite).</li>
    <li>To define the inputs, press the <b><nobr>Define and Edit
    Connections</nobr></b> button to open the <nobr>Edit Connections</nobr>
    panel:
      <img src="cdgen/define.png" alt="Edit Connections" class="center" />

<p>In the <b>Scaffold</b> section, select <b>MOE</b> to use just the
      molecule in the <b>MOE Window</b>, or select the <b>Database</b> option
      and enter the name of the database to use.</p>

<p>To name the attachment points on a scaffold molecule, you can use the
      <a href="../moe/molsystems/build.htm">Builder</a>. You can also use the
      <a href="cliprg.htm">Clip R-Groups</a> application in a database to
      create fragments with named attachment points.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: Scaffold attachment points should usually be labeled in
      the sequence A1, A2, etc., whereas R-group attachment points must be
      labeled using A0 (for monodentate) or A0 &amp; A1 (for bidentate).</p>
    </li>
    <li>Define the connection points between the scaffold(s) and the R-groups
    by using the <b>Add Connection</b> button, once for each connection.</li>
    <li>Attachment points on the scaffold are associated with a database of
    R-group molecules which are to be substituted at that point.
      <ul>
        <li>Monodentate R-groups have a single point of attachment to the
        scaffold. To define the connection point on the scaffold, select the
        R-group fragment database to associate with the connection point and
        press <b>Add Connection</b>. The port numbers are automatically
        assigned. If you wish to change the port number, select the connection
        and use the <b>Change Ports</b> buttons below the list.</li>
        <li>Bidentate R-groups have two points of attachment to the scaffold.
        To assign the second port, select the connection in the list and then
        choose the port using the <b>Bidentate</b> push buttons.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Not all defined ports need be used. Only connections in the selected
    set will be used when the <b>Use Selected Entries Only</b> box is
    checked.</li>
    <li>Press <b>Error Report...</b> to open a text editor containing a report
    on the currently defined connections.</li>
    <li>Press <b>OK</b> in the <nobr>Edit Connections</nobr> panel. The
    QuaSAR-CombiGen panel now displays connection information in the
    Connections area. The scaffold port(s) and associated R-group database name
    and connection type (monodentate or bidentate) are shown.

<p>The status line below the connections indicates the maximum number of
      compounds that can be generated using the currently specified scaffold(s)
      and R-groups.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Press <b>OK</b> to generate the combinatorial library. The virtual
    library is written to the output database in a molecule field called
    <tt>mol</tt>.</li>
    <li>If the generated molecules contain unused ports, the output database
    can be used without any additional processing as a scaffold database in a
    subsequent combinatorial library generation operation.</li>
  </ol>

<p>A defined set of inputs might resemble the following:</p>
  <img src="cdgen/cdgen2.png" alt="QuaSAR-CombiGen Panel" class="center" />
<a id="Results"></a>
<h1>Interpreting the Results</h1>

<p>MOE assigns each combinatorial product a unique molecule name which is
  composed of the original names (if any) of the fragment molecules making up
  the final molecule and the entry numbers of those fragments in their
  respective databases, along with the name of the attachment points on the
  scaffold. Thus, the molecule name can be parsed to determine which fragments
  were combined to produce a given product.</p>

<p>A scaffold molecule fragment is assigned a name of the following form:</p>
  <p class="blockquote">
    C<i>n</i>.<i>scaff_name</i>
  </p>

<p>where:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><i>n</i> is the entry number of the scaffold in the scaffold database
    (<i>n</i>=1 if using the currently loaded molecule in MOE)</li>
    <li><i>scaff_name</i> is the name, if any, of the original scaffold
    molecule</li>
  </ul>

<p>Each R-group is assigned a name of the following form:</p>
  <p class="blockquote">
    <i>port</i>.<i>n</i>.<i>rgp_name</i>
  </p>

<p>where:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><i>port</i> is the name of the attachment point on the scaffold
    associated with the A0 port on the R-group (true for both monodentate and
    bidentate R-groups)</li>
    <li><i>n</i> is the entry number of the R-group in the R-group
    database</li>
    <li><i>rgp_name</i> is the name, if any, of the original R-group
    molecule</li>
  </ul>

<p>As each R-group fragment is substituted onto the scaffold, its name is
  appended to the name of the partial product, separated by a &quot;/&quot;
  character. Here is an example of the name of a complete product:</p>
  <p class="blockquote">
    C2.benzene/A1.5.F/A2.3.N/A3.1.Cl
  </p>

<p>The scaffold, named <tt>benzene</tt>, is the second entry in the scaffold
  database. Port A1 on the scaffold is substituted by the 5th entry, named
  <tt>F</tt>, in the R-group database associated with that attachment point.
  Similarly, port A2 is substituted by the 3rd entry (named <tt>N</tt>), and
  port A3 by the 1st entry (named <tt>Cl</tt>), of their respective associated
  R-group databases.</p>

<p>Associated with each product is a flag indicating whether the product was
  successfully generated. A value of <tt>1</tt> indicates success; a <tt>0</tt>
  indicates that there were errors in the input fragments, e.g. missing ports.
  The flags are written in a separate field named <tt>$IS_CORRECT</tt>.
<a id="Errors"></a>
</p>

<h3>Validation Report</h3>

<p>QuaSAR-CombiGen detects and produces a report of the errors in the input
  molecular data. Also reported are the total number of products generated, as
  well as the number of correct products, i.e. products generated from molecule
  fragments that contained no detected errors. The error report is sent to the
  SVL Commands window output area as well as optionally to an SVL Text
  Editor.</p>

<p>The following are treated as errors:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Scaffold molecule missing any of the ports specified as an attachment
    point for an R-group database</li>
    <li>Scaffold molecule having multiple instances of a port which has been
    specified as an attachment point for a bidentate R-group</li>
    <li>Monodentate R-group having zero or more than one A0 port</li>
    <li>Bidentate R-group having zero or more than one A0 or A1 port</li>
    <li>Port atom which does not have exactly 1 bonded neighbor</li>
    <li>Molecule fragment comprising more than 1 residue</li>
  </ul>

<p>When ports are missing or other errors are encountered, the output product
  will be incorrect and may consist of solely the scaffold or a partial
  product. A field containing flags indicating whether the product was
  successfully constructed is written to the output database.

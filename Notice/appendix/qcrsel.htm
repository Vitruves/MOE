<p>The QuaSAR-Reagent application is used to estimate the activity of
  R-groups and <i>scaffold</i> (also called <i>central</i>) molecules in a
  virtual combinatorial library. By assigning an activity score to each such
  building block, a pure combinatorial design can be achieved by using this
  activity information first to cluster the <span class="nobr">R-groups</span>
  and scaffold molecules and then to select the best candidates. The virtual
  library is constructed by functionalizing scaffold molecules. QuaSAR-Reagent
  estimates the activity information by statistical sampling of the
  &quot;chemical space&quot; spanned by all possible R-group/scaffold
  substitutions.</p>
<a id="Theory"></a>
<h1>Theory and Formulation</h1>

<p>QuaSAR-Reagent is able to search diverse subsets from extremely large
  virtual libraries for one simple reason: <i>the virtual library is never
  enumerated</i>. In conventional techniques, one first enumerates the library
  by forming all combinations of scaffolds and R-groups followed by activity
  evaluation. QuaSAR-Reagent uses sampling techniques for each of the
  sub-calculations thereby avoiding the enumeration.</p>

<p>The Basic Sampling Operation is used to select a random member of the
  virtual library spanned by the scaffold and <span class="nobr">R-group</span>
  databases. The Basic Sampling Operation proceeds as follows:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Randomly select a scaffold molecule.</li>
    <li>Randomly select R-group molecules.</li>
    <li>Construct the product.</li>
    <li>Test against Rule of Five Filter; i.e. if any of Molecular Weight,
    LogP, Number of donors+acceptors, Number of rotatable bonds falls outside
    pre-set limits then return to step 1 (a maximum of 1000 times).</li>
  </ol>

<p>Imagine counting the number of times that a given R-group or scaffold
  group molecule <i>m</i> appears in a biologically active compound. We can
  express this count as: <!-- <span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
A\left( m \right) = \sum_{k} \delta \left( \textrm{k is active} \right)
    \delta \left( m \in k \right)
\end{align}
</span> --></p>

<img src="qcrsel/math_qcrsel_eq0.png" class="center" />

<p>where the sum extends over all compounds <i>k</i> in the virtual library.
  The assessment of activity used is a Binary QSAR model, which outputs the
  probability that a compound is active. We therefore can replace the activity
  assessment with a softer (probabilistic) one: <!-- <span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
A\left( m \right) = \sum_{k} \textrm{Pr} \left( \textrm{k is active} \right)
    \delta \left( m \in k \right)
\end{align}
</span> --></p>

<img src="qcrsel/math_qcrsel_eq1.png" class="center" />

<p>To avoid enumerating the library, we replace the summation with a Monte
  Carlo integration as follows. We assume a uniform sampling of the virtual
  library and sample <i>p</i> molecules. This gives:</p>
  <!-- <span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
A\left( m \right) \approx
    \frac{1}{p} \sum_{i=1}^{p} \textrm{Pr} \left( X_{i} \textrm{ is active} \right)
    \delta \left( m \in X_{i} \right) \frac{1}{1 / V}
\end{align}
</span> -->

<img src="qcrsel/math_qcrsel_eq2.png" class="center" />

<p>where <i>V</i> is the number of compounds in the virtual library and
  <i>X<sub>i</sub></i> is the <i>i</i><sup>th</sup> of <i>p</i> sampled
  molecules. To avoid explicit use of the number of compounds in the virtual
  library, we can normalize the count by dividing by the total number of active
  compounds in the virtual library:</p><!-- <span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
P\left( m \right)
    =
    \frac{
        \frac{1}{p} \sum_{i=1}^{p}
            \textrm{Pr}\left( X_{i} \textrm{ is active} \right)
            \delta \left( m \in X_{i} \right)
            \frac{1}{1 / V}
    }{
        \frac{1}{p} \sum_{i=1}^{p}
            \textrm{Pr}\left( X_{i} \textrm{ is active} \right)
            \frac{1}{1 / V}
    }
    =
    \frac{
        \sum_{i=1}^{p}
            \textrm{Pr}\left( X_{i} \textrm{ is active} \right)
            \delta \left( m \in \bar{X}_{i} \right)
    }{
        \sum_{i=1}^{p}
        \textrm{Pr}\left( X_{i} \textrm{ is active} \right)
    }
\end{align}
</span> -->

<img src="qcrsel/math_qcrsel_eq3.png" class="center" />

<p>This approximate value to <i>P</i>(<i>m</i>) is what is written as output
  for each source database R-group or central group.</p>
<a id="Run"></a>
<h1>Running QuaSAR-Reagent</h1>

<p>To open the QuaSAR-Reagent panel choose <span class="menu">MOE | Compute |
  QuaSAR | QuaSAR-Reagent</span> in the MOE Window. The panel is operated in
  the style of a &quot;Wizard&quot;; that is, a sequence of pages that specify
  the parameters to the calculation. The <b>Next</b> and <b>Previous</b>
  buttons are used to move between the pages. The <b>Start</b> button becomes
  available on the last page and is used to start the calculation. The
  <b>Cancel</b> button can be used at any time to terminate the
  calculation.</p>

<p><b>Page 1: Virtual Library Definition</b>. The first page contains fields
  used to specify the virtual library:</p>
  <img src="qcrsel/reagent.png" alt="Reagent Library" class="center" />

<p>The filenames of the databases used in a QuaSAR-Reagent run are shown on
  this page, and can be specified using the <b>Define and Edit Connections</b>
  button. QuaSAR-Reagent generates new compounds by randomly functionalizing
  scaffold molecules from the <b>Scaffold</b> database with R-groups from
  databases specified in the <b>Connections</b>. Functionalizations occur
  between terminal atoms named &quot;Ax&quot; (where x is an integer from 0 to
  9) on the scaffold molecules and terminal atoms named &quot;A0&quot;
  (&quot;A&quot; zero) on the R-groups. The overall functionalization
  &quot;reaction&quot; is:</p>
  <center>
    Scaffold-Ax + A0-R -&gt; Scaffold-R ; x = 0 to 9
  </center>

<p>In bidentate connections, a second connection is made from the scaffold to
  a terminal atom named &quot;A1&quot; in an R-group. Connections are specified
  by pressing the <b>Define and Edit Connections</b> button.</p>

<p>Scaffold structures are created by renaming the atoms at the desired
  points of substitution with the tokens A0 to A9. Each scaffold molecule must
  contain at least one atom named &quot;Ax&quot; to be recognized as a valid
  scaffold by QuaSAR-Reagent. Symmetric substitutions are achieved by giving
  multiple atoms the same name. Bidentate substitutions are also supported, as
  are substitutions through higher-order bonds. Bidentate connections are
  specified when defining or editing a connection in the <b>Edit
  Connections</b> panel. Naming non-terminal atoms &quot;Ax&quot; can result in
  errors and unreasonable structures.</p>

<p>R-groups are created by renaming the atom at the desired point of
  substitution with &quot;A0&quot;. R-groups must contain one and only one
  &quot;A0&quot; atom to be correctly recognized by QuaSAR-Reagent. R-groups
  may also contain a terminal atom labeled A1, in which case the group can be
  used in a bidentate connection. If the group has other atoms labeled
  &quot;Ax&quot; (x is not 0 or 1), then these can be used as substitution
  points in subsequent invocations of QuaSAR-CombiDesign. In this way you can
  set up a multi-step &quot;reaction&quot;. You may label a multiply-bonded
  atom with &quot;A0&quot; or &quot;A1&quot;, in which case the substitution
  will be made through a higher-order bond. Naming non-terminal atoms
  &quot;A0&quot; will result in errors and unreasonable structures.</p>

<p>For more information about scaffolds, R-groups, and specifying
  connections, please see the chapter on <a href=
  "cdgen.htm">QuaSAR-CombiGen</a>.</p>

<p>The filenames of the output databases are also specified in this first
  page. The output database for the scaffold molecules is specified in the
  <b>Scaffold Output Database</b> text field. The names of the R-group output
  databases will be the same as the R-group source databases, prefixed by the
  <b>R-Group Name Prefix</b>.</p>

<p><b>Page 2: Rule of Five Filter</b>. Virtual Library compounds are
  constructed by randomly choosing a scaffold molecule and functionalizing it
  with random R-groups. The Rule of Five Page is used to reject virtual library
  members with a collection of filters:</p>
  <img src="qcrsel/pg_rule.png" alt="Rule of 5" class="center" />

<p>A constructed virtual library member will only be used if its Molecular
  Weight, LogP (octanol/water), number of donors + acceptors and number of
  rotatable bonds fall between the limits specified in the Rule of Five Filter
  page. If any one of the tests fail then the constructed molecule is rejected
  and another is randomly chosen.</p>

<p><b>Page 3: Model</b>. The biological activity of sampled virtual library
  molecules are evaluated with a model. The model can be of various types:
  <a href="../quasar/model.htm">linear and binary QSAR</a>, <a href=
  "../apps/ph4_guide.htm">pharmacophore</a>, <a href=
  "../mdb/fpmodel.htm">fingerprint</a>, and <a href=
  "../quasar/modcomp.htm">composite (MOE model)</a>.</p>
  <img src="qcrsel/pg_model.png" alt="Model" class="center" />

<p>The Model page allows for the specification of the model and the duration
  of the calculation. An optional reference database can also be specified.
  This reference database must contain compounds and activity data. The
  specified model is evaluated over the database, and, from the model accuracy,
  coefficients C<sub>0</sub> and C<sub>1</sub>, used to weight subsequent model
  predictions, are calculated. The weighted predictions and not the original
  values are then used by QuaSAR-Reagent calculations as follows:
  <!-- <span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
p_{reagent} = C_{0} + C_{1} * p_{model}
\end{align}
</span> --></p>

<img src="qcrsel/math_qcrsel_eq4.png" class="center" />

<p>A previously saved model filename must be entered in the <b>Model File</b>
  text field. The <b>Iterations</b> count controls the number of samples used
  in the calculation. If <i>k</i> is entered for <b>Iterations</b>, then the
  number of iterations is <i>km</i> where <i>m</i> is the number of molecules
  in the largest source database.</p>

<p>The optional reference database is specified in the <b>Reference</b> text
  field. Generally, this database must contain molecular data. The database
  must also contain a numeric <b>Activity field</b>. At least one of the
  <b>Lower Threshold</b> and <b>Upper Threshold</b> must be specified.
  Checkboxes are used to enable or disable the use of the individual
  thresholds. The thresholds are applied to the activity data to determine
  which entries in the reference database are to be deemed active. If the lower
  threshold is specified, an entry will be considered active only if its
  activity value is greater than or equal to the threshold value. If the upper
  threshold is specified, the entry will be considered active only if its
  activity value is less than the threshold value. If both thresholds are
  specified, the entry is considered active only if its activity value
  satisfies both upper and lower threshold requirements.</p>

<p><b>Page 4: Start Simulation</b>. This is the final page of QuaSAR-Reagent.
  The <b>Start</b> button must be pressed to begin the calculation.</p>

<p>If MOE/cluster (MOE/smp) is enabled, the calculation will be distributed
  over the available host machines.
<a id="Output"></a>
</p>

<h1>QuaSAR-Reagent Output</h1>

<p>QuaSAR-Reagent outputs to both the CLI and to the output database. CLI
  output echoes the process which QuaSAR-Reagent is currently performing, and
  can be used to monitor the progress of the calculation. The QuaSAR-Reagent
  run options are first output as a tagged vector, followed by a summary of the
  Scaffold and R-group databases. At the end of the run, the names of the
  output databases are echoed, and an estimate is given of the number of
  actives present in the virtual combinatorial library.</p>

<p>The database output consists of a copy of each input database used in the
  calculation along with a new field in each one with the name '$ACT'.
  This field contains an estimate of the proportion of active compounds in the
  entire virtual library that contain the corresponding component. That is, the
  '$ACT' field numbers will sum to 1 in any given database, with higher
  numbers indicating that a higher proportion of active compounds contain that
  R-group or scaffold group.</p>

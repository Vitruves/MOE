<h1>Fingerprint Basics</h1>

<p>Elements known as <i>structural keys</i>, <i>signatures</i>, or
  <i>molecular fingerprints</i> (or, more simply, <i>fingerprints</i>)
  represent a set of features derived from the structure of a molecule. The
  particular features calculated from the structure can be quite arbitrary and
  depend on the topology of the chemical graph or even a 3D conformation.
  Different fingerprint schemes emphasize different molecular attributes
  according to the design philosophy of the fingerprint system. The fundamental
  idea is to encapsulate certain properties directly or indirectly in the
  fingerprint and then use the fingerprint as a surrogate for the chemical
  structure. Comparisons between molecules are then reduced to comparing sets
  of features and measuring the degree to which sets overlap.</p>

<p>MOE Fingerprints can be used for</p>
  <ol>
    <li><a href="ph4clust.htm">Fingerprint Clustering</a> to group molecules
    based on the similarity of their fingerprint.</li>
    <li><a href="fpmodel.htm">Fingerprint Models</a> to study Quantitative
    Structure Activity Relationships using fingerprint descriptions of the
    molecules.</li>
    <li><a href="ph4sim.htm">Similarity Searching</a> to find molecules with
    similar fingerprints.</li>
  </ol>

<p>As a simple example, consider a universe of features consisting of:</p>
  <center>
    <i>U</i> = { is-aromatic, has-ring, has-C, has-N, has-O, has-S, has-P,
    has-halogen }
  </center>

<p>Based on this definition of features, <i>all</i> molecules are described
  by subsets of <i>U</i>. Note that, in this small universe of 8 features,
  there are only 2<sup>8</sup> (256) possible fingerprints, which means that
  all chemical structures will be mapped to one of 256 possible subsets. In
  other words, there are only 256 possible &quot;molecules.&quot; Examples
  might be:</p>
  <center>
    <table class="noborder">
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td align="center"><img src="ph4intro/c6h6.png" /></td>
        <td align="center">{ is-aromatic, has-ring, has-C }</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td align="center"><img src="ph4intro/c4h8.png" /></td>
        <td align="center">{ has-ring, has-C }</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td align="center"><img src="ph4intro/c4no.png" /></td>
        <td align="center">{ has-C, has-N, has-O }</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td align="center"><img src="ph4intro/c4nf.png" /></td>
        <td align="center">{ is-aromatic, has-ring, has-C, has-N, has-halogen
        }</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </center>

<p><b>Metrics.</b> Once a fingerprint is derived from a chemical structure, a
  metric is needed to compare fingerprints (and thus compare molecules). A
  common metric is the <i>Tanimoto coefficient</i>, suitable for use, for
  example, in ranking compounds in virtual screening assays. The Tanimoto
  coefficient can take on values between 0 and 1 inclusive, where 0 means
  &quot;maximally dissimilar&quot; and 1 means &quot;maximally similar.&quot;
  The Tanimoto coefficient between fingerprints <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> is
  defined to be:</p>
  <center>
    # features in intersect(A,B) / # features in union(A,B)
  </center>

<p>which is, roughly speaking, the number of common features divided by the
  number of total features in both fingerprints. For example, the Tanimoto
  coefficient between molecules 1 and 2 in the above table is:</p>
  <center>
    # { has-ring, has-C } / # { is-aromatic, has-ring, has-C} = 2/3 = 0.666
  </center>

<p>The Tanimoto coefficient can be used as a threshold to define similarity;
  in this case, any value can act as the threshold. For example, two compounds
  having a Tanimoto coefficient greater than or equal to 0.6 can be considered
  &quot;similar.&quot;</p>

<p>The primary concern in designing a fingerprint system is determining what
  features to use. The example above reveals one of the problems with
  fingerprints. The is-aromatic and has-ring features are not independent:
  whenever is-aromatic is present has-ring is also present. This has the effect
  of overemphasizing ring structures in the similarity measures (since each
  feature is counted with equal weight in the Tanimoto coefficient). In
  practical fingerprint systems, the problem remains but becomes more difficult
  to pinpoint as there may be hundreds or thousands of features.</p>

<p><b>Similarity Matrices.</b> A <i>similarity matrix</i> can be defined for
  a collection of compounds by calculating the Tanimoto coefficient between
  each pair. For example, the above collection of four compounds have the
  following similarity matrix:</p>
  <center>
    <table class="noborder">
      <tr>
        <td>1.00</td>
        <td>0.66</td>
        <td>0.20</td>
        <td>0.60</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>0.66</td>
        <td>1.00</td>
        <td>0.25</td>
        <td>0.40</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>0.20</td>
        <td>0.25</td>
        <td>1.00</td>
        <td>0.33</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>0.60</td>
        <td>0.40</td>
        <td>0.33</td>
        <td>1.00</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </center>

<p>Each element (<i>i</i>,<i>j</i>) is the Tanimoto coefficient between
  molecules <i>i</i> and <i>j</i>. The similarity matrix has a number of uses.
  In particular, it can be used to cluster compounds by partitioning them into
  subsets such that each subset consists of molecules that are mutually
  similar. It can also be used to calculate Euclidean vectors whose
  inter-vector distances approximate the similarity matrix (this is called
  Euclidean Embedding).</p>

<p><b>Representations.</b> In computational procedures, fingerprints are not
  represented as collections of character strings. The fundamental quantity to
  represent is the <i>set</i>, which can be done in a number of ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><i>Bit Vectors</i>. In the bit vector set representation, each feature
    in the universe <i>U</i> is assigned a natural number {1,2,3,...,<i>n</i>}
    where <i>n</i> is the total number of features in the universe. Any subset
    of <i>U</i> can then be represented by an <i>n</i>-vector, <i>x</i>, of
    ones and zeros where <i>x<sub>i</sub></i> = 1 if and only if feature
    <i>i</i> is in the set. This representation is efficient since eight
    features can be encoded in one byte and similarity metrics consist of AND
    and OR operations on the bits.</li>
    <li><i>Folded Bit Vectors</i>. One of the drawbacks of the bit vector
    representation is memory consumption. If the universe consists of 1,000,000
    features, then every set (no matter how small) requires 1,000,000/8 =
    125,000 bytes of storage. One way around this is to <i>fold</i> the bit
    vectors, i.e. map them onto a lower dimensional bit-vector. For example, if
    we allocate 1,000 bits per fingerprint, then each bit becomes a
    &quot;bucket,&quot; i.e. it represents many other bits in the full bit
    vector. Thus, if a bit is 1, one is not sure of exactly which feature is
    contained in the feature set; however, in practice, such
    &quot;collisions&quot; can be neglected in certain applications.</li>
    <li><i>Feature Lists</i>. Another way of getting around the sparseness of
    the feature set for an individual compound (most molecules rarely contain a
    large proportion of the total feature universe) is to store each set as a
    list of feature numbers. Assign a unique integer to each feature and store
    the resulting fingerprint as a variable length list of integers. Thus,
    small molecules generally use up less memory than large molecules; however,
    each feature will require 1 word of computer memory to store.</li>
  </ul>

<p>Ultimately, the representation of a fingerprint will depend on the total
  number of features in the universe <i>U</i> and the average number of
  features present in an individual molecule.</p>

<h1>MOE Fingerprint System</h1>

<p>Several fingerprint systems are implemented in MOE. Moreover, additional
  systems can be implemented in SVL, thereby extending the list of core
  fingerprint systems. Applications that use fingerprints will generally offer
  the choice of all available fingerprint methods in MOE. This is done by
  assigning a unique code, or name, to each fingerprint system. Each
  fingerprint system will support a number of similarity metrics and use
  different representations. Typically, selection of fingerprints and metrics
  is performed in a Fingerprint Chooser panel:</p>
  <img src="ph4intro/choose_sim.png" alt=
    "Fingerprint Chooser (Cluster) Panel" class="center" />

<p>The top list allows selection of the fingerprint system while the bottom
  list allows selection of a comparison metric (once a fingerprint has been
  chosen). A MOE fingerprint system is defined by the following quantities:</p>
  <table class="noborder">
    <tr>
      <td valign="baseline"><tt><b>fp_code</b></tt></td>
      <td valign="baseline">Unique name of the fingerprint system, for example,
      <tt>FP:MACCS</tt> for the 166 MACCS keys fingerprint system. The purpose
      of the code name is to identify fingerprint systems and indicate which
      molecular database fields contain the fingerprints themselves. In
      general, if a database has a field with the code name then it is assumed
      that the contents of the field are correct fingerprints.</td>

      <td valign="baseline">One-line description of the fingerprint system.

        features in fingerprint A, #B the number of features in fingerprint B,

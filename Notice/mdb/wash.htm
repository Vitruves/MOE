  <!-- =========================== BACKGROUND =============================== -->
<a id="Methods">
<h1>Methods</h1>
</a>

<p>Prior to conducting an operation on a database of molecules, it is often
  desirable to apply to each molecule a set of cleaning rules such as removing
  extraneous salts or adjusting protonation states, in order to ensure that
  each structure is in a form suitable for subsequent modeling steps such as
  conformation enumeration and protein-ligand docking. The Database Wash
  application is suitable for applying a preparation policy to all entries in a
  MOE molecular database.</p>

<p>The Database Wash application proceeds by applying the following
  operations to each input structure, with each step being optional:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Replace or recalculate the molecule name.
    </li>
    <li>Disconnect simple metal salts drawn in covalent notation.
    </li>
    <li>Remove minor components (e.g. counterions and solvent molecules),
      optionally storing the removed components in an alternate field.
    </li>
    <li>Rebalance protonation states by deprotonating strong acids and/or
      protonating strong bases.
    </li>
    <li>Add explicit hydrogen atoms, or remove safely-deletable explicit
      hydrogen atoms.
    </li>
    <li>Replace the atomic coordinates with an aesthetic 2D depiction
      layout.
    </li>
    <li>Regenerate 3D coordinates via 3D embedding followed by minimization or
      using the external program <a href=
      "../moe/extprog.htm#Corina">Corina</a>.
    </li>
    <li>Enumerate tautomers and possibly also protonation states.
    </li>
    <li>Filter enumerated structures according to strong acid/base rules.
    </li>
  </ol>

<p>The following sections describe the various wash operations which are
  pertinent to MOE molecular databases. The results of the wash operation can
  be written back to the original database, or they can be emitted to a new
  database. When using the tautomer/protomer enumeration mode, the output must
  be written to a new database, since a one-to-many relationship is established
  between the input and output.</p>

<p>A similar set of operations is available for application directly to MDL
  SD files, which is described in the documentation for the <a href=
  "../moe/fcnref/sdwash.htm"><tt>sdwash</tt></a> command line tool.
</p>

<a id="MolName">
<h2>Molecule Naming</h2>
</a>

<p>In a MOE molecular database, each entry has an optional molecule name,
  which is shown in the database viewer when the viewing size of the field is
  shrunk to a single line. The molecule name can originate from a variety of
  sources, such as importation from another database format which supports
  molecule names (e.g. MDL SD files), or canonical name calculation (e.g.
  <span class="nobr"><b>DBV | Compute | Molecule | <a href=
  "dbedit.htm#MoleculeNames">Molecule Name</a></b></span>). Regardless of
  whether the molecule name is a computed property or a registration key, it is
  potentially useful for tracking the progress of a chemical entity after it is
  subjected to various calculations.</p>

<p>When washing a database, the molecule name can be left unaltered, or it
  can be replaced with a canonical SMILES string, or its value can be set to
  the value of a field which is also present in the database.
</p>

<a id="Depict">
<h2>2D Depiction</h2>
</a>

<p>If the database is being prepared for a purpose which involves viewing of
  the molecules, it is often desirable to have the geometry of the molecules
  replaced by a 2D layout which conforms to aesthetic diagram conventions.
  Using the MOE 2D depiction algorithm [Clark&nbsp;2006], a suitable layout can
  be produced for each molecule, such that the molecules in the database can be
  easily viewed in place, or exported to external applications.
</p>

<a id="3DCoords">
<h2>3D Coordinates</h2>
</a>

<p>If the database is being prepared for a purpose which involves 3D
  structures, it is often desirable to have the molecular geometry replaced by
  lower-energy 3D coordinates. This, for example, could be used to transform a
  database containing SMILES strings into one that could be used by <a href=
  "../apps/docking.htm">Docking</a>. This can be done in one of two ways: a
  cyclic embedder based on distance geometry and refinement or with the
  external program Corina.
</p>

<a id="Hydrogen">
<h2>Addition or Removal of Hydrogen Atoms</h2>
</a>

<p>Many sources of molecular data are stored in hydrogen-suppressed mode, and
  it is therefore assumed that the number of hydrogen atoms attached to each
  atom in the structure can be computed by a formula which takes into account
  atomic element, charge, bond orders, and various other possible annotations
  such as radical state. While for most organic molecules this calculation is
  simple and unambiguous, the implicit hydrogen count can be unreliable for
  atoms which are hypervalent, are not in the organic block of the periodic
  table, or have unusual properties such as radicals or carbenes, which are not
  always appropriately annotated.</p>

<p>When washing a molecular database with addition of hydrogen atoms, the
  algorithm that is used for determining the number of hydrogen atoms to add to
  each heavy atom is the same as is used throughout MOE, and is equivalent
  to:</p>

<pre>    implicitH = aHCount akeys - aExplicitHCount akeys</pre>

<p>For each heavy atom which has an implicit atom count of greater than zero,
  the corresponding number of hydrogen atoms will be created. New hydrogen
  atoms are added to the end of the molecule entry, and bonded to their parent
  atom. For calculated negative numbers of implicit hydrogen atoms, no action
  is taken.</p>

<p>The method used for removing hydrogen atoms from input structures is by
  contrast very conservative, since most file formats do not have a field for
  storing the number of implicit hydrogen atoms. When converting a molecule
  into a hydrogen-suppressed representation, explicit hydrogen atoms are only
  deleted if there is no ambiguity whether they can be safely recreated.</p>

<p>Explicit hydrogen atoms are considered safe to delete if they meet all the
  following criteria:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Terminal</li>
    <li>Neutral</li>
    <li>Sigma-bonded</li>
    <li>Not annotated as an attachment point (A0, A1, ..., A9)</li>
    <li>The parent atom is one of: B, C, N, P, As, O, S, Se, Te, F, Cl, Br,
    I</li>
    <li>For the parent atom: valence + bond orders - charge = 8</li>
  </ul>

<p>All other hydrogen atoms are considered unsafe to delete, and will remain
  in the output molecule.
</p>

<a id="SaltDisc">
<h2>Salt Disconnection</h2>
</a>

<p>For metal salts, multiple drawing conventions are sometimes used. For many
  computational purposes, it is desirable to prevent salts from being drawn in
  their covalent form, e.g. Na(+).Cl(-) is preferable to Na-Cl.</p>

<p>The washing rules used for converting covalently bound atom pairs into
  ionic salts are conservative, and only apply if all the following conditions
  are met:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The electropositive element is one of Li, Na, K, Rb or Cs</li>
    <li>The electronegative element is one of C, N, O, F, P, S, Cl, Se, Br,
    I</li>
    <li>Both elements have an ionic charge of 0</li>
    <li>The electropositive element is terminal</li>
    <li>Both atoms are connected by a single bond</li>
  </ul>

<p>For any atom pair where all these conditions are satisfied, the bond is
  removed, the electropositive atom is set to +1 and the electronegative atom
  to -1.
</p>

<a id="RemMinor">
<h2>Removal of Minor Components</h2>
</a>

<p>For many purposes, it is necessary to ensure that there is only one
  connected component in the final output, which typically involves removing
  salts (including those which may have been algorithmically disconnected, see
  previous section), small adducts and solvent molecules. The method used to
  determine which is the major component is to count the number of heavy atoms
  in each fully bonded set of atoms, and keep only that which has the largest
  number. In the event of a draw, the first component is retained.</p>

<p>If the database contains major components which have fewer heavy atoms
  than the unwanted components, then this feature will not produce the desired
  result for these cases.
</p>

<a id="AcidBase">
<h2>Acids and Bases</h2>
</a>

<p>Protonation state of certain functional groups can be adjusted to the most
  probable state in an aqueous environment by enabling the deprotonation of
  strong acids and protonation of strong bases.</p>

<p>Certain functional groups are considered to be always protonated or always
  deprotonated when dissolved in near-neutral water. If these options are
  enabled, they will be adjusted accordingly.</p>

<p>For functional groups which have a pKa of close to 7, which cannot
  reasonably be classified as being exclusively protonated or deprotonated, no
  modifications are made, and the protonation state of the input molecule is
  taken to be instructive.</p>

<p>The following functional motifs may be classified as being either strong
  acids or strong bases:</p>
  <div align="center">
    <table class="noborder">
      <tr>
        <th>Acids</th>
        <th>Bases</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="wash/acids.png" />&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="wash/bases.png" />&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

<p>For hydroxy acids, the <b>X</b> attachment is defined to be a conjugated
  electron withdrawing group which is analogous to a carbonyl substituent.
  Amines are also considered acidic if they have two strongly electron
  withdrawing substituents.</p>

<p>A subset of nitrogen centers are considered to be basic. Any amine which
  has a combination hydrogen and sp3 carbon substituents is considered a strong
  base. N=C-N centers are considered basic if they are aliphatic and do not
  feature electron withdrawing substituents.</p>

<p>An option exists to neutralize acids and bases. First, an attempt is made
  to find a protonation state in which all the atoms are neutral. If this
  proves impossible, then an attempt is made to find a protonation state in
  which the species is neutral overall. If this also fails, the least
  charge-bearing form of the structure is determined.
</p>

<a id="TautProt">
<h2>Tautomers and Protomers</h2>
</a>

<p>Many molecular species exist in solution as an ensemble of tautomers and
  protonation states, and for some purposes it is not sufficient to assume that
  a single variation of the structure is sufficiently representative to
  describe the properties of the molecule. It is possible to use the Database
  Wash application to enumerate the set of kinetically accessible tautomers,
  and optionally produce all the titration states of acidic or basic functional
  groups.</p>

<p>The tautomer &amp; protomer enumeration algorithm is based on a collection
  of molecular transformations, which match particular functional areas of
  interest, and modify some of the regional molecular properties, which may
  include hydrogen count, charge and bond order. The transformations are
  divided into three distinct types:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Tautomer isomerizations, which involve the movement of a single
    hydrogen atom and some number of double bonds</li>
    <li>Resonance charge migration, which involves the movement of an ionic
    charge and some number of double bonds</li>
    <li>Protonation or deprotonation, which involves adding or subtracting a
    single proton</li>
  </ul>

<p>The algorithm for generating tautomers is a stepwise breadth first search,
  which proceeds as follows:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Define result set as containing the input structure only</li>
    <li>Produce a new set by applying all available transforms to all the
    molecules which were added to the result set in the previous iteration</li>
    <li>Exclude any new results which have appeared before</li>
    <li>If no new results remain, stop</li>
    <li>Append new set to result set</li>
    <li>Go to 2 and repeat.</li>
  </ol>

<p>The enumeration process therefore collects derivative species which are
  further separated from the original input structure with each iteration, but
  are otherwise not ordered. Due to the nature of the algorithm used, it is
  necessary to use a cutoff value for the number of results which may be
  returned, since the number of possible results is exponentially dependent on
  the number of certain moieties (e.g. a molecule which has 8 isolated
  ketone-enol opportunities and no symmetry will have no less than 256 possible
  tautomers; when enumerating protomers as well, the presence of large numbers
  of basic and/or acidic functional groups also causes a combinatorial
  explosion).</p>

<p>The transformation rules for tautomers have been implemented from a
  literature report on tautomer generation [Selzer 2006], with minor
  modifications.</p>

<p>Resonance equivalence for charged species are modeled on the following
  templates, with other elements being able to substitute for nitrogen or
  oxygen in some cases:</p>
  <div align="center"><img src="wash/resonance.png" /></div>

<p>Multiple resonance forms of the same molecular species may be enumerated
  during the operation of the algorithm, and may lead to the production of
  otherwise unobtainable tautomers or protomers, but they are themselves
  considered degenerate representations of the same molecule, so only one
  instance of each is retained in the final output. For this reason, the
  resonance enumeration is largely invisible to the user.</p>

<p>A number of functional groups containing polar hydrogen atoms are
  considered worth enumerating in both the acid form and as the conjugate base.
  Some examples of recognized patterns are shown below:</p>
  <div align="center">
    <table class="noborder">
      <tr>
        <th>(1)</th>
        <td><img src="wash/wacid1.png" /></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>(2)</th>
        <td><img src="wash/wacid2.png" /></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>(3)</th>
        <td><img src="wash/wacid3.png" /></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>(4)</th>
        <td><img src="wash/wacid4.png" /></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>(5)</th>
        <td><img src="wash/wacid5.png" /></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

<p>Hydroxy substituents are deprotonated when they are close to a conjugated
  electron withdrawing moiety, such as in carboxylic acids or conjugated
  diketone tautomers (1). Similarly, -OH substituents attached to certain
  inorganic centers such as oxidized phosphorus and sulfur are deprotonated
  (2). Phenols and thiophenols are considered to be not worth enumerating,
  unless an electron withdrawing substituent is found in the <i>ortho</i> or
  <i>para</i> position (3). C-hydroxy and N-hydroxy patterns of small oxidized
  nitrogen-containing functional groups are typically enumerated (4). The
  tetrazole functional group is known to be acidic, and will be reversibly
  deprotonated, but less nitrogen-substituted heterocycles will not be (5).</p>

<p>A small number of nitrogen-containing structural motifs are considered
  suitably basic to be worth enumerating both protonated and unprotonated
  forms:</p>
  <div align="center">
    <table class="noborder">
      <tr>
        <th>(1)</th>
        <td><img src="wash/wbase1.png" /></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>(2)</th>
        <td><img src="wash/wbase2.png" /></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>(3)</th>
        <td><img src="wash/wbase3.png" /></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>(4)</th>
        <td><img src="wash/wbase4.png" /></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

<p>Primary amines which are bonded to a combination of hydrogen or sp3 carbon
  atoms are considered basic, while those with non-sp3 carbon substituents are
  not (1). N-C=N structural fragments are reversibly protonated, but only if
  none of the constituent atoms are in a pi-ring (2). The 4-aminopyridine
  fragment is reversibly protonated on two sites (3). Imidazole is considered
  basic and is protonated, unless the 5-membered ring is fused to a larger
  aromatic system (4).

        <span class="nobr"><b>Add Explicit Hydrogens</b></span> is enabled, the
        hydrogen atoms will be re-added back individually for each enumerated
        case, since the number of hydrogen atoms varies.

      <td valign="top">If <span class="nobr"><b>Depict 2D</b></span> is

      results of the 2D depiction layout algorithm. If the wash is enumerative,
      the depiction layout will be performed for the input molecule immediately
      prior to the enumeration step, and the same heavy-atom coordinates will
      be used for all the tautomers and protomers.<br />

      If <span class="nobr"><b>Rebuild 3D</b></span> is selected, the
      coordinates of the washed species will be replaced by the those generated
      by a cyclic 3D embedding based on distance geometry followed by
      refinement. If <span class="nobr"><b>Corina</b></span> is selected, the

      the external program Corina.<br />

      If <span class="nobr"><b>Scale to Reasonable Bond Lengths</b></span>
      is on, molecule coordinates will be scaled so that the average bond length
      is characteristic of a 2D diagram layout. This is useful when the source
      molecules have abnormally short bond lengths as produced by some drawing
      programs.<br />

      is on, the chirality of unconstrained R/S stereo centers and E/Z
      double bonds in the input structure will be preserved. Constrained
      stereo centers and double bonds will always be preserved.</td>

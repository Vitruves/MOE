<p>A number of useful databases are distributed with MOE. Some are designed
  for use with specific MOE applications while others are for more general
  use.</p>

<h1>Small Molecule Databases</h1>

<p><b>Leadlike Conformer Database.</b> The MOE Conformation Database contains
  3D conformations in MOE Molecular Database (.mdb) format for approximately
  650,000 (Oprea) lead-like chemical structures. These are ready to be used for
  pharmacophore searching, fingerprint analysis, and so on. The structures were
  obtained from chemical suppliers' public catalogs, including the
  following:</p>

<p>The conformations were generated using Conformational Search with the
  default forcefield in MOE. A maximum of 500 conformers were generated for
  each molecule, resulting in a limit of roughly 4 kcal/mol strain energy. The
  results were filtered using a heavy-atom RMSD tolerance of 1.0&Aring; to
  create the final set of conformers. These databases
  (<tt>leadlike_conf_###.mdb</tt>) can be obtained from the
  <a href="https://data.chemcomp.com" target="_blank">MOE
  Auxiliary Databases</a> download page.
  </p>

<p><b>RECAP Fragments.</b> <tt>$MOE/opt/recaplib.mdb</tt> is the output of
  RECAP analysis on a collection of ~750,000 diverse lead- and drug-like
  chemical structures from vendor catalogs and medicinal chemistry journals. It
  can be used with the <a href="../apps/recap.htm">RECAP Panel</a>.</p>

<h1>Protein Databases</h1>

<p><b>Non-redundant PDB.</b> <tt>$MOE/project/pdb.mdb</tt> is a database of
  non-redundant domains derived from the PDB. Domains were clustered such that
  all pairs of domains within a cluster had 90% pairwise sequence identity as
  well as similar structure. One representative was chosen from each cluster
  based on resolution, R free, and number of missing residues. Nearby ligands
  and solvent atoms are included in each entry. This database may be searched
  with the <a href="gui/fileopen.htm#MOEPDB">MOE-PDB page</a> of the <a href=
  "gui/fileopen.htm">Open panel</a>.</p>

<p><b>Protein Families.</b> The non-redundant set of PDB chains is further
  clustered structurally to form families. These structure-based sequence
  alignments are stored in the <tt>$MOE/project/pdb.fam.gz</tt> file in
  (compressed) plain text. Small families are enhanced with additional
  sequences from UniRef 50. This file can be used during <a href=
  "../proteins/prosearch.htm">Homology Searching</a> to identify possible
  templates to a query.</p>

<p><b>Antibody Modeling Databases</b>. The central building block for
  knowledge-based <a href="../proteins/antibody.htm">antibody homology
  modeling</a> is the antibody MOE Project database, which constitutes the
  information pool of the antibody homology modeling procedures. The current
  antibody structure collection (MOE&nbsp;2018) is composed of over 4200
  V<sub>L</sub>:V<sub>H</sub> complexes, as well as several hundred monomers,
  stored in <tt>$MOE/project/Antibody.mdb</tt>.</p>

<p>For more information, see the <a href="../proteins/pdb_mdb.htm#fabDB">MOE
  Antibody Database</a> section.</p>

<p><b>Kinase Modeling Databases</b>. The MOE kinase database is part of the
  MOE Project databases, and is found at <tt>$MOE/project/Protein
  Kinase.mdb</tt>. After their identification, kinase chains are further
  classified based on their sequence identity within the kinase core. If this
  is at least 45% within one of the classes in the reference file
  <tt>$MOE/lib/kin_ref.fam.gz</tt>, that class is assigned; otherwise a check
  is conducted to verify if the sequence is sufficiently close to one of the
  known pseudo kinases in the pseudo reference file
  (<tt>$MOE/lib/kin_refpseudo.fam.gz</tt>). If the sequence identity is higher
  than 35%, the sequence group is labeled as <i>Pseudo-Kinase</i>. Sequences
  that are positive with respect to kinase pattern detection (G-Loop, DFG and
  HRD) but lack sufficient homology with the reference sequences are not given
  any classification for a kinase group, family, or subfamily. This might apply
  for distant species like bacteria, parasites, nematodes etc., since the
  reference collection is biased towards the detection of human kinases. In
  addition to classifications based on sequence, the conformational states of
  distinct topologies such as the DFG segment or alpha-C helix are also stored
  in the database.</p>

<p>For more information, see the <a href="../proteins/pdb_mdb.htm#kinDB">MOE
  Kinase Database</a> section.</p>

<p><b>GPCR Structure Database</b>. The G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)
  comprise the largest family of integral membrane proteins and one of the most
  important classes of drug targets. In an effort to assist in 3D structure
  modeling and function annotation, the GPCR Class A structure repository is
  provided with the other MOE Project databases in <tt>$MOE/project/GPCR Class
  A.mdb</tt>.</p>

<p>For more information, see the <a href="../proteins/pdb_mdb.htm#gpcrDB">MOE
  GPCR Database</a> section.</p>

<p><b>MOE Project Databases</b>. A number of protein family databases &mdash;
  including antibodies, kinases and GPCRs &mdash; are provided in the
  <tt>$MOE/project</tt> directory. These databases have been created using the
  <a href="../proteins/moeproject.htm">MOE Project</a> framework, and are all
  very similar in construction and appearance. Each is superposed into a common
  frame of reference based on the core region of the reference <tt>.moe.gz</tt>
  files, which are also found in <tt>$MOE/project</tt>. The databases can all
  be used with the <a href="../proteins/projsrch.htm">Project Search</a> panel
  as the repository for all relevant information used in this application.</p>

<p>For more information, see the <a href="../proteins/pdb_mdb.htm#projDB">MOE
  Project Database</a> section.</p>

<p><b>Rotamer Library.</b> The <a href="../proteins/buildrotlib.htm">Rotamer
  Library</a> in MOE is a collection of all-atom sidechain conformations
  created using LowModeMD. These conformations differ from traditional rotamer
  libraries in that bond length and angle variations are permitted. The intent
  is to provide adequate coverage of the conformational space available to a
  sidechain and not just encode dihedral preferences. The rotamers are located
  in <tt>$MOE/opt/rotamers.mdb</tt> in a packed conformation field associated
  with each sidechain.</p><!--

<p>
<b>Protein-Ligand Complex Database.</b> <tt>$MOE/sample/mol/complex.mdb</tt>
contains a set of structures from the PDB with experimental binding affinities.
For each entry, <b>ligand</b> stores the ligand for which binding was measured,
and <b>receptor</b>, the nearby chains.  <b>image</b> contains symmetry-related
molecules which are near the ligand, if any, and <b>water</b> contains any
water chains.  <b>dG</b> contains the experimental binding affinity of the
ligand in kcal/mol, obtained from various sources in the literature.
<b>degeneracy</b> indicates the number of copies of the ligand found in the PDB
file; each copy will have its own row in the database.  The other fields
contain summary information about the structure from the PDB file.  This
database can be used for validation studies.

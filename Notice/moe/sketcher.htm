<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>MOE provides functionality to edit molecules in a 2D environment by
  seamlessly connecting to the following chemical drawing programs: Biovia
  Draw, ISIS/Draw, ChemDraw, Symyx Draw, Accelrys Draw, MarvinSketch, and
  JDraw. These programs are not included as part of the MOE package and must
  obtained separately and installed on your workstation.</p>
<a id="Setting_Up"></a>
<h1>Setting Up</h1>

<p>MOE can connect to a variety of 2D sketchers. The supported sketchers and
  their operating systems are summarized in the following table.</p>

<table class="titlebar">

<p>By default, the sketcher that will be used is taken from the above table
  in the order given and based on availability. However, user preferences can
  also be specified in the <b>Builder</b> page of the
  <span class="menu">Configuration Options</span>
  panel, opened using <span class="menu">MOE |
  <img src="sketcher/settings.png" alt="Settings" style=
  "vertical-align: middle" /></span>.
</p>

  <div class="center"><img src="sketcher/config_builder.png" alt=
  "Builder" class="center" /></div>

<p>The <b>Set</b> button allows for specifying the preferred
sketcher or sketchers to be used when a <b>Sketch</b> button
is pressed in MOE.
The <b>Class Path</b> text field is used to specify the location of
the jar files of those Java sketchers.  The full paths of all jar
files are entered as a semi-colon separated list.  To specify all
jar files in a directory, use the wildcard <tt>&quot;*&quot;</tt>.
</p>

<p>
  The sketcher preferences can also be set explicitly using the RC variables
  <tt>sketcher.programs</tt> and <tt>sketcher.classpath</tt>.
</p>

<p>
  By using the <tt>sketcher.programs</tt> RC variable, the
  order of preference of the sketchers associated with MOE
  can be set.  For example,
  the following SVL command makes ChemDraw the default sketcher
  program, and Biovia/Accelrys/Symyx Draw the second choice after
  ChemDraw:</p>

<pre class="code">
svl> SetRC ['sketcher.programs', 'ChemDraw.Document MDLDraw.Document']
</pre>

<p>For MOE to connect to the Java sketchers MarvinSketch(Java) and JDraw, the
  appropriate Java jar files must be specified using the
  <tt>sketcher.classpath</tt> RC variable. The Java classes will be dynamically
  loaded each time the sketcher is launched. <b>Note</b>: MOE uses the forward
  slash '/' as a path separator. The following is an example of an SVL
  command for specifying the Java sketchers on Windows:</p>

<pre class="code">
svl&gt; SetRC ['sketcher.classpath', \
        '%chemaxon_marvin_path%/MarvinBeans/lib/MarvinBeans.jar;\
         %accelrys_jdraw_path%/lib/jdrawcore.jar' ]
</pre>

<p>Alternatively, the jar files can be included in the environment variable
  <tt>CLASSPATH/SVL_CLASSPATH</tt>.</p>

<p>Here is an example of how this is done on Windows. In a Windows
  terminal:</p>

<pre class="code">
set CLASSPATH=%chemaxon_marvin_path%\MarvinBeans\lib\MarvinBeans.jar;^
 %accelrys_jdraw_path%\lib\jdrawcore.jar
</pre>

<p><span class="tip">Note:</span>
When using MarvinSketch, make sure its <a href=
  "https://docs.chemaxon.com">licenses</a> are installed before launching it
  from MOE. Newer MarvinSketch versions might not provide the file
  <tt>MarvinBeans.jar</tt> in their <tt>lib</tt> directory; if this is the case,
  specify the MarvinSketch <tt>lib</tt> directory path in the class
  path RC variable.
  </p>


<a id="Running"></a>
<h1>Running a Sketcher Program from MOE</h1>

<p><span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Sketch</span> invokes a sketcher program
  and transfers molecular data between the sketcher and MOE. For example,
  molecules from MOE can be displayed and edited in ChemDraw, and then the
  changes brought back into MOE once editing in the sketcher is complete. A 2D
  sketcher is most suitable for small edits to small molecules and is a
  complementary tool to the 3D small molecule <a href=
  "../moe/molsystems/build.htm">Builder</a>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Selection</b>. When <b>Sketch</b> is pressed, the currently selected
      atoms are sent to the sketcher. The selection will auto-extend to the
      residues and, if belonging to a ligand, to the entire molecule. If no
      atoms are selected, the data received from the sketcher will be created
      as a new molecule centered in the MOE Window. Selection of multiple
      molecules is also permitted, but it is recommended to edit only one
      molecule at a time for best performance.

<p><b>Note:</b> Sending large molecules to a sketcher can be time
      consuming. The number of atoms transferred cannot exceed 999 due to
      limitations of the <tt>mol</tt> file format.</p>

<img src="sketcher/sketch_sel.jpg" alt=
      "Molecule Selection" class="center" />
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Data Transfer</b>. Molecular data is sent to the sketcher program once
      the <span class="menu">Sketch</span> button is pressed. A recognized
      transfer action is required for sending data back to MOE. For ChemDraw,
      this action occurs when the program window is closed. For others, the
      action occurs when <b>Transfer</b> is pressed in the sketcher program.

<p><b>Note:</b> Some features are not supported through this transfer,
      such as query structures and special symbols e.g. '*', etc.</p>

<img src="sketcher/sketch_trf.png" alt=
      "Sketch & Transfer" class="center" />
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Molecule Updates</b>. The molecular data received from the sketcher
      will be converted into 3D and hydrogens will be added to fill valence. A
      maximum of 20 embedding attempts will be made to generate the 3D
      structure, followed by energy minimization. A warning will appear if the
      conformation does not match the current stereochemistry in MOE.

<img src="sketcher/sketch_upd.jpg" alt=
      "Molecule Update" class="center" />
    </li>
  </ul>


<a id="Import"></a>
<h1>Import Sketches</h1>

<img src="sketcher/sketch_imp.png"
 alt="Sketcher Import panel" class="floatright" />

<p>
  If a sketcher program is launched while the
  MOE system is empty or no atoms are selected, a new molecule or new
  molecules will be created.  In this case, the transferred sketched molecule(s)
  will first be shown in the
  <b><span class="nobr">Import Sketch</span></b> panel, where
  the sketched molecule(s) can be reviewed.</p>
<p>
  The upper portion of the panel shows in 2D
  the transferred sketched molecule. If more than one
  molecule was transferred, they can be browsed individually using the
  <img src="sketcher/browse_icon.png" class="icon" /> buttons.
  To modify the currently shown molecule, press
  <img src="sketcher/edit_icon.png" class="icon" />,
  which will reopen the external sketcher program with that molecule loaded.
  To add more molecules to the Import Sketch panel, press
  <img src="sketcher/add_icon.png" class="icon" />, which will reopen
  the sketcher.
  To remove the current molecule from the import list, use the
  <img src="sketcher/delete_icon.png" class="icon" /> button.</p>

<p>
  The sketched molecule(s) can either be loaded into MOE, or added
  to a new or existing database:</p>

<table class="noborder">
  <tr>
    <td><b>Load into MOE</b></td>
    <td>Sketched molecule(s) are loaded into the MOE system.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Create New Database</b></td>
    <td>A new database is created, and the sketched molecule(s) added
    as separate entries. The name of the new database file can be
    specified.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b><span class="nobr">Add to Existing Database</span></b></td>
    <td>Add sketched molecule(s) to an existing database. Currently
    open databases which are writeable and have a molecule field can be
    selected as the destination. If a database has more than one molecule
    field, the <b>Field</b> to receive the sketched molecules can
    be specified.
    Additional databases can be added to the list of database choices
    with the <img src="sketcher/open_icon.png" class="icon" /> button.
    </td>
  </tr>

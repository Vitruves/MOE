<p>The Builder is used to build or edit organic molecules, primarily in 3D.
  Typical uses of the builder include correcting molecules read in from files
  and building molecules for further calculations such as conformational
  analysis, QSAR, docking and combinatorial library design. Although MOE
  provides a variety of tools for building and editing molecules (such as the
  <a href="../../proteins/probuild.htm">Protein Builder</a>, <a href=
  "../../apps/carbo.htm">Carbohydrate Builder</a>, or Copy and Paste from 2D
  Sketchers like ChemDraw, IsisDraw, SymyxDraw), this chapter concerns itself
  with the Builder, which can be run using
  <b>MOE&nbsp;|&nbsp;Edit&nbsp;|&nbsp;Build&nbsp;|&nbsp;Molecule</b> or the
  <b>Builder</b> button in the right button bar of the MOE Window.</p>

<p>Molecules are built or edited primarily by substituting atoms (typically
  hydrogens). The Builder operates on atoms selected in the MOE Window; i.e.,
  select atoms <i>first</i> then operate on them with buttons in the Builder.
  The functionality available in the Builder depends on which atoms are
  selected. Some of the button labels turn blue to highlight the properties of
  the selected atoms, such as element, ionization, chirality, etc.</p>

<h1>Add Functional Group</h1>

<p>The primary means of constructing molecules is by substitution of terminal
  atoms, typically hydrogens. Use the <b>Add&nbsp;H</b> button to add hydrogens
  to hydrogen suppressed structures. Heavy atoms (non-H, non-LP) with one heavy
  neighbor are also considered terminal atoms for substitution purposes. One or
  more terminal atoms can be selected and each will be substituted with other
  groups:</p>
  <table class="noborder">
    <tr>
      <td align="center"><img src="build/elements.png" alt="Elements" /></td>
      <td valign="top">Each selected atom will be replaced with the chosen
      element. Use <b>More</b> to access the full periodic table. The Du
      pseudo-element is treated in a special way: if there is one atom selected

      has two heavy neighbors then a spiro ring will be created. Rings not in
      the list can be created by selecting the closest ring and then changing
      bonds or elements with the Builder. Alternatively, SMILES can be input

<a id="ChangeElement"></a>
<h1>Change Element</h1>
  <div class="floatleft"><img src="build/elements.png" alt="Elements" class="floatleft" /></div>

<p>To change the element symbol of existing atoms, select the atoms in the
  MOE Window and press an element button in the Builder. Hydrogens will be
  adjusted to satisfy valence requirements. If the chosen element is
  over-ligated then the ionization will be adjusted; e.g. a quaternary carbon
  replaced by a nitrogen will become N+ and replacing a benzene carbon with
  oxygen will result in O+.</p>

<p>Bond orders will be preserved for organic elements but changing an atom to
  a metal will result in all single bonds (possibly affecting neighboring
  atoms).</p>

<p>Use <b>More</b> for access to the full periodic table. The Du
  pseudo-element is treated in a special way: if there is one atom selected
  then it will be replaced with the LP pseudo-element; if more than one atom is
  selected then a dummy atom will be created at the centroid of the selected
  atoms.</p>
<a id="ChangeAtomName"></a>
<h1>Change Atom Name</h1>
  <div class="floatleft"><img src="build/aname.png" alt="Atom Name" class="floatleft" /></div>

<p>To change the name of an atom (not its symbol), select the atoms in the
  MOE Window, then enter the atom name in the textfield and press Enter. The
  Name pulldown contains attachment point names A0-A9 for use in <a href=
  "../../apps/combitools.htm#RunCombi">combinatorial library generation</a>.
  Atom names are limited to four characters; blanks will be automatically
  stripped. The <b>Sym</b> button replaces each selected atom's name with
  its element symbol (the default). The <b>Index</b> button replaces each
  atom's name with its index in its residue.</p>

<p>Atom names can be displayed or hidden by turning on or off labels with
  <span class="menu">MOE | Render | Atoms</span>. If one atom is selected, then
  its name is displayed in the MOE Window footer.</p>

<p><b>Note!</b> The Atom Name textfield will only appear in the Builder if it
  is enabled in <span class="menu">MOE | <img src="build/gear_wheel.png" style=
  "vertical-align:middle" /> | Builder</span>.
<a id="ChangeIon"></a>
</p>

<h1>Change Ionization</h1>
  <div class="floatleft"><img src="build/ion.png" alt="Ionization" class="floatleft" /></div>

<p>To change the ionization state of atoms, select them in the MOE Window and
  press one of the formal charge buttons in the Builder. Changing the
  ionization of a hydrogen atom will change the ionization of the attached
  heavy atom; for example, if the H in COOH is selected and <b>-1</b> is
  pressed then carboxylate will result: CO[O-]. The Builder will clamp
  ionizations to enforce reasonable values; for example, it is not possible to
  neutralize a quaternary nitrogen, nor is it possible ionize an atom below its
  valence electron count.
<a id="ChangeBond"></a>
</p>

<h1>Bond, Unbond and Bond Order</h1>
  <div class="floatleft"><img src="build/bond.png" alt="Ionization" class="floatleft" /></div>

<p>To create a new bond, select two atoms that are not bonded and then press
  the Single, Double or Triple bond buttons in the Builder. These buttons may
  be grayed out if valence does not permit a particular bond order. If
  disconnected fragments comprising separate residues are joined together, the
  atoms may be combined into one residue provided no receptor residues are
  involved.</p>

<p>To disconnect atoms, select them in the MOE Window and then press the
  Unbond button (the button with the red X). If more than one atom is selected,
  then all bonds between selected atoms will be deleted. Hydrogens will be
  adjusted to fill valence. If the deletion of a bond results in disconnected
  fragments, new residues will be created to avoid having disconnected
  fragments in a single residue.</p>

<p>To change a bond order, select the two atoms on either side of the bond
  (or click in the middle of the bond itself) and press the Single, Double or
  Triple bond buttons in the Builder. Double bonds creating allenes are
  permitted only if exactly two atoms are selected. Note that the ionization
  state of the atoms may change as a result of the bond order change.</p>

<p>If more than two atoms are selected then the Single bond button will
  change all bonds connecting selected atoms to single bonds. If more than two
  atoms are selected then the Double and Triple bond buttons will create the
  largest number of double or triple bonds along the bonds connecting the
  selected atoms (allenes will not be created in such cases). For example,
  selecting all of the carbons in cyclohexane and pressing the Double bond
  button will result in benzene.
<a id="FuseRings"></a>
</p>

<h1>Fuse Rings</h1>
  <table class="noborder">
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><img src="build/ring.png" alt="Ring Buttons" /></td>
      <td valign="top">To add a fused ring, select two bonded atoms in a ring
      and press one of the ring buttons in the Builder. If three atoms are
      selected then the fused ring will contain the selected atoms; similarly
      for four selected atoms. Selecting two heavy atoms and two hydrogens is a
      good way of controlling the resulting stereochemistry when fusing
      saturated rings. Spiro rings can be created by selecting a single atom in
      a ring (with a maximum of two heavy neighbors) then pressing one of the
      ring buttons.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
<a id="Delete"></a>
<h1>Delete</h1>

<p>The <b>Delete</b> button deletes the selected atoms (and attached
  hydrogens) and all bonds connecting them to other atoms. Ionization may be
  adjusted for the remaining atoms previously connected to the deletion set
  (e.g. when deleting an oxygen in a sulfone). Residues and chains that are
  emptied after the operation are also deleted. In simple cases, if the
  deletion results in a disconnected residue then the residue is split into
  multiple residues, one for each connected component.</p>

<h1>Combinatorial Builder</h1>

<p>The <b>Fragments</b> button becomes active when one or two terminal atoms
  or free rotors are selected. It treats the selected atoms (and associated
  hydrogens) as attachment points, and combinatorially generates energetically
  allowed alternatives from a small library of monodentate, chemically-relevant
  R-groups. The <a href="../../apps/frag_combi.htm#TorsDriver"><b>Torsion
  Driver</b></a> is used to generate R-group energies and orientations.</p>

<p>Press the <b>Fragments</b> button to generate a set of structures, each
  with one or more rotamers. By default, structures are ordered by decreasing
  efficiency (R-group energy divided by the number of R-group heavy atoms,
  minimum 1) and rotamers are ordered by increasing conformational energy
  penalty. As they are calculated from energies, efficiencies can often be
  negative. The list contains the names of the R-groups used to create each
  structure. Upon completion, the selected atoms are replaced by the
  highest-efficiency structure; selecting a different list entry loads its
  lowest-energy rotamer into the builder. Pressing the <font color=
  "red"><b>X</b></font> button reverts to the original structure and atom
  selection.</p>

<p>The up and down arrow buttons can also be used to browse the structure
  list. Shift+Up selects the first structure and Shift+Down selects the last.
  The left and right arrow buttons are used to browse the rotamers for each
  structure. Shift+Left selects the lowest-energy and Shift+Right selects the
  highest energy rotamer. The rotamer energy, efficiency and count are provided
  in the GUI. The structures cannot be reviewed when atoms are selected, and
  the list is cleared when external changes are made to the system.</p>

<p>The <b>Sort</b> button below the list reorders the list based on R-group
  energy, efficiency or by either R-group if two are present. The
  <b>Save&nbsp;MDB</b> button above the list
  writes the generated structures to a user-specified database. The
  <b>Keep</b> button duplicates the current structure in MOE (core +
  fragments), naming it and making it invisible and inert.  The
  <b>R-Groups</b>
  button opens the <b>Fragments R-groups</b> sub-panel and provides an
  alternate means to visualize and pick structures and
  rotamers. Clicking on any structure in the <b>Fragments R-Groups</b> panel
  loads its lowest-energy rotamer. Clicking successively on the same structure 
  loads successively higher-energy alternatives.
  The arrow keys at the bottom of the <b>Fragments R-groups</b> panel
  are used to navigate to the next or previous pages, or the first
  and last pages.</p>

<p>The database created by <b>Save&nbsp;MDB</b> contains a number of
fields:</p>

<table class="titlebar">

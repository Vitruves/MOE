<h1>Syntax</h1>

<h1>Description</h1>
<a id="WashMoleculeMOE"></a>
<a id="WashMoleculeCTAB"></a>
<pre>
[ctablist, changed, filtlist] = <span class=
"fcndef">WashMoleculeMOE</span> [akeys, opt]
[ctablist, changed, filtlist] = <span class=
"fcndef">WashMoleculeCTAB</span> [ctab, opt]
</pre>

<p>Both functions provide a sequence of &quot;wash&quot; steps for a
  molecular connection table. <tt>WashMoleculeMOE</tt> accepts an input
  molecule by way of atom keys, which are internally converted to a CTAB
  representation, while <tt>WashMoleculeCTAB</tt> takes a CTAB
  datastructure.</p>

<p>The first return value, <tt>ctablist</tt>, is a list of molecular
  structures in CTAB form. For most washing modes, this will consist of just a
  single entry. The <tt>changed</tt> value is a flag which is set to 1 if any
  significant modifications were made, or 0 if the input molecule was already
  &quot;clean&quot;. <tt>filtlist</tt> contains a list of CTAB structures
  representing anything that was filtered out during the washing sequence.</p>

<p>The actual steps carried out during the washing process is determined by
  the contents of the <tt>opt</tt> argument, which takes the following
  form:</p>
  <div class="indent">
    <dl>
      <dd></dd>
      <dt><tt>dim</tt> : <i>number</i></dt>
      <dd>The dimensionality of the input coordinates. The default value, 0,
      means that it is not known what significance the input coordinates have,
      and an educated guess will be made when necessary. A value of 1 means
      that they are definitely meaningless; a value of 2 means that the
      coordinates are from a 2D depiction, and a value of 3 means that they are
      from a 3D model. For some structure normalization, it is necessary to
      know the dimensionality of the structure, e.g. wedge bonds are only
      meaningful for 2D sketches, while cis/trans alkene stereochemistry is
      meaningful for both 2D and 3D structures.</dd>
      <dt><tt>depict</tt> : <i>flag</i></dt>
      <dd>If set to 1, then the coordinates of the input structure will be
      replaced by the results of a 2D depiction layout. The default is 0 (the
      coordinates will not be modified).</dd>
      <dt><tt>scale</tt> : <i>flag</i></dt>
      <dd>If set to 1, then the X and Y coordinates of the input structure will
      be examined to see if the average bond distance is approximately
      1.5&Aring;. If not, then the coordinates will be scaled so that this is
      the case. The default is 0 (no scaling).</dd>
      <dt><tt>hydrogens</tt> : <i>token</i></dt>
      <dd>By default, explicit hydrogens will not be modified (<i>token</i> is
      set to <tt>''</tt>). If set to <tt>'add'</tt>, then any
      missing explicit hydrogen atoms will be created, and their positions will
      be assigned appropriately (either 2D or 3D geometry). If set to
      <tt>'del'</tt>, then explicit hydrogen atoms will be deleted -
      except those for which cannot be recreated unambiguously using a simple
      Lewis valence formula.</dd>
      <dt><tt>ylide</tt> : <i>flag</i></dt>
      <dd>If set to 1, then ylide standardization rules are applied. Functional
      groups which may be represented by either charge-separated or double-bond
      notation are converted into a single form regardless of how they were
      input. The selected form is that which is most commonly used for 2D
      sketches, e.g. <tt>P=O</tt> and <tt>S=O</tt> bonds are represented as
      double bonds, whereas the nitro group is represented as
      <tt>[N+](=O)[O-]</tt>. The default is 0 (no standardization
      performed).</dd>
      <dt><tt>chiral</tt> : <i>flag</i></dt>
      <dd>If set to 1, derives chiral parity values for chiral atoms which do
      not already have a chiral parity, as long as the chirality can be
      determined either from 3D geometry or 2D geometry combined with wedge
      bonds. The default is 0 (no chirality is derived).</dd>
      <dt><tt>wedge</tt> : <i>flag</i></dt>
      <dd>If set to 1, wedge bonds will be rederived from chiral parity values.
      This should only be used if the input molecules are definitely 2D, or
      combined with the <tt>depict</tt> option. The default is 0 (no
      recalculation of wedge bonds is done).</dd>
      <dt><tt>salts</tt> : <i>flag</i></dt>
      <dd>If set to 1, disconnection of covalently bound simple salts is
      performed, e.g. <tt>CC(=O)O[Na]</tt> is converted into
      <tt>CC(=O)[O-].[Na+]</tt>. The default is 0 (no disconnection is
      done).</dd>
      <dt><tt>component</tt> : <i>flag</i></dt>
      <dd>If set to 1, then all connected components are removed except the one
      with the largest number of heavy atoms (or the first, in the event of a
      tie). Excised components are returned in the filter list. If used with
      the <tt>salts</tt> flag, the salt disconnection is carried out first,
      i.e. the small ions will be removed. The default is 0 (no components are
      removed).</dd>
      <dt><tt>protomers</tt> : <i>flag</i></dt>
      <dd>If set to 1, then protomer enumeration will be enabled. Tautomer
      enumeration is implicitly enabled, and the result will likely contain
      multiple structures. The default is 0 (no protomer enumeration is
      performed).</dd>
      <dt><tt>pH</tt> : <i>number</i></dt>
      <dd>The pH of the aqueous environment. The default is 7.0.</dd>
      <dd></dd>
      <dt><tt>original</tt> : <i>flag</i></dt>
      <dd>If nonzero, the original structure will be retained when protomers
      are calculated. Otherwise, the original and all enumerated structures
      compete equally.</dd>
      <dd></dd>
      <dt><tt>neutralize</tt> : <i>flag</i></dt>
      <dd>If set to 1, then any species which has localized charge (other than
      ylide bonds) will be subjected to an attempt to prepare an entirely
      neutral representation. If an entirely neutral structure can be achieved
      by reversing standard aqueous protonation/deprotonation rules, the result
      can be obtained quickly. Otherwise, it is necessary to perform a full
      protomer enumeration in order to search for the result with the lowest
      charge magnitude. This situation is often triggered by protonation states
      which are linked to double bond migration. The default is 0 (no
      neutralization is done).</dd>
      <dt><tt>exclacids</tt> : <i>flag</i></dt>
      <dd>Enumeration modes only. If set to 1, then the resulting
      tautomers/protomers will be filtered so that species which contain an
      acidic functional group which is normally deprotonated in aqueous
      solution are excluded from the result list, and added to the filter list
      instead. The default is 0.</dd>
      <dt><tt>exclbases</tt> : <i>flag</i></dt>
      <dd>The counterpart to <tt>exclacids</tt>, except that it filters out
      species with basic functional groups which are normally protonated in
      aqueous solution. The default is 0.</dd>
      <dt><tt>enumsize</tt> : <i>number</i></dt>
      <dd>When an enumeration mode is being used, the default maximum size is
      10 structures, which can be overridden with this option.</dd>
      <dt><tt>enumdup</tt> : <i>flag</i></dt>
      <dd>If set to 1, enumerated molecules will be filtered in order to remove
      structures which are topologically equivalent. If set to 0 (default),
      then topological duplicates will be retained. This is most often
      appropriate when an input molecule has specific 3D geometry, e.g. a
      ligand bound in an active site, for which normal symmetry rules do not
      apply.</dd>
      <dt><tt>AB_rules</tt> : <i>laminated vector</i></dt>
      <dd>This parameter can be specified as a laminated vector of the form
      <nobr><tt>[type, smarts]</tt></nobr>, where each is an array of tokens.
      Each entry of <tt>type(i)</tt> must be one of: <tt>'none'</tt>,
      <tt>'acid'</tt> or <tt>'base'</tt>. The corresponding
      <tt>smarts(i)</tt> value must be a token which is a valid SMARTS string.
      If the type is <tt>'acid'</tt>, then any atom which matches the
      SMARTS string needs to be deprotonated; if the type is
      <tt>'base'</tt> then matching atoms need to be protonated; if the
      type is <tt>'none'</tt>, then no change is required. The action
      to be applied to each atom is taken from the first SMARTS string that it
      matches, so matching a type of <tt>'none'</tt> causes subsequent
      rules to be ignored.</dd>

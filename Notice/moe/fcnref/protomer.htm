<h1>Description</h1>

<p>Tautomer and protonation state (or <i>protomer</i>) enumeration of small
  molecules is accomplished by an aqueous pK<sub>a</sub> model that uses
  connection table information alone (atomic coordinates are not used).</p>
<a id="ctab_ProtomerList"></a>
<hr noshade="noshade" />

<pre>
[ctlist, pC] = <span class="fcndef">ctab_ProtomerList</span> [ctab, opt]
</pre>

<p>The <tt>ctab_ProtomerList</tt> function enumerates protonation states of a
  given input molecule <tt>ctab</tt>, in <a href="ctabfcn.htm">CTAB</a> format.
  Explicit hydrogen atoms are treated as inviolate honorary heavy atoms during
  the enumeration; therefore, in order for the enumeration to have any effect,
  the input representation must have some or all explicit hydrogen atoms
  subsumed into the <tt>CTAB_A_HCOUNT</tt> field. One way to obtain a suitable
  input is:</p>

<pre class="code">
svl&gt; ctab = ctab_Extract [akeys, [heavy:1]]
</pre>

<p>The <tt>opt</tt> parameter is a tagged vector that controls the
  enumeration:</p>
<div class="indent">
  <dl>
    <dd></dd>
    <dt><tt>barrier</tt> : <i>num</i></dt>
    <dd>Protomer states with a relative log<sub>10</sub> concentration less
    than <tt>-barrier</tt> are deemed insignificant and are discarded. This
    (internal) cutoff applies throughout the calculation and is important for
    tautomeric transformations and represents a thermodynamic barrier limit;
    lower values will lead to loss of certain tautomeric states. Generally,
    this option should not be changed from the default; the <tt>cutoff</tt>
    parameter should be used to limit results. The default is 6.0.</dd>
    <dd></dd>
    <dt><tt>cutoff</tt> : <i>num</i></dt>
    <dd>Protomer states with a relative log<sub>10</sub> concentration (to
    the most common species) less than <tt>-cutoff</tt> are discarded. This
    cutoff applies only to the structures returned and does not affect the
    enumeration itself. This parameter is the preferred method of limiting
    the results while preserving accuracy. If the given value is negative
    then the number of states is the entropic count of states: the integer
    closest to 10<sup>H</sup> where <nobr>H = sum {
    pC<sub>i</sub>&nbsp;10<sup>-pC<sub>i</sub></sup> }</nobr>. The default is
    -1.</dd>
    <dd></dd>
    <dt><tt>pH</tt> : <i>number</i></dt>
    <dd>The pH of the aqueous environment. The default is 7.0.</dd>
    <dd></dd>
    <dt><tt>original</tt> : <i>flag</i></dt>
    <dd>If nonzero, the original structure will be retained when protomers
    are calculated. Otherwise, the original and all enumerated structures
    compete equally.</dd>
    <dd></dd>
    <dt><tt>limit</tt> : <i>number</i></dt>
    <dd>At most the specified number of protonation states will be returned.
    Setting this number too low will adversely affect the accuracy of the
    returned concentrations. The default is 256.</dd>
    <dd></dd>
    <dt><tt>protect</tt> : <i>mask</i></dt>
    <dd>A mask that applies to the atoms of the input molecule. Non-zero
    elements indicate that the protonation state of the corresponding atoms
    will not be modified. The default is 0. Unit extension applies.</dd>
    <dd></dd>
    <dt><tt>protectR</tt> : <i>flag</i></dt>
    <dd>If nonzero, atoms with non-negative <tt>CTAB_A_RGROUP</tt> values
    will be protected in addition to the protected atoms specified by
    <tt>protect</tt>. This means that fragments with R-group annotations can
    be specified without change to the protonation state of the R# atoms. The
    default is 1.</dd>
    <dd></dd>
    <dt><tt>unique</tt> : <i>flag</i></dt>
    <dd>If nonzero, then only topologically unique protonation states are
    returned; for example, only one of <tt>C(=O)[OH]</tt> and
    <tt>C([OH])=O</tt> will be returned (with twice the concentration as when
    <tt>unique</tt> is zero). If the given flag is zero, then each atom is
    considered topologically distinct; this mode is useful when the input
    molecule has well defined 3D coordinates. The default is 1.</dd>
    <dd></dd>
    <dt><tt>updateStereo</tt> : <i>flag</i></dt>
    <dd>If nonzero, then stereo annotations in the results will be removed on
    atoms that are involved in keto-enol type tautomers. Double bond stereo
    will be removed on bonds that are not double bonds in all protomer
    states; atom stereo (and wedges) will be removed on atoms with a multiple
    bond in some protomer state. The default is 1.</dd>
    <dd></dd>
    <dt><tt>pos3D</tt> : <tt>[x,y,z]</tt></dt>
    <dd>If non-null then <tt>pos3D</tt> contains the 3D coordinates of all
    the atoms in the <tt>ctab</tt>. Supplying 3D coordinates will affect the
    results since torsion strain energies will be taken into account. When 3D
    information is supplied, the <tt>unique</tt> option should be 0. The
    default is <tt>[]</tt>.</dd>
    <dd></dd>
    <dt><tt>env3D</tt> : <i>mol</i></dt>
    <dd>If non-null then <tt>env3D</tt> must be a MOL structure containing
    the 3D environment about the molecule. Hydrogen bond interactions with
    the environment will affect the resulting concentrations. When 3D
    information is supplied, the <tt>unique</tt> option should be 0. The
    default is <tt>[]</tt>.</dd>
    <dd></dd>
    <dt><tt>verbose</tt> : <i>flag</i></dt>
    <dd>If true, information will be written to the SVL Commands window
    during the calculation. The default is 0.</dd>
  </dl>
</div>

<p>The returned <tt>ctlist</tt> is a vector of <a href="ctabfcn.htm">CTAB</a>
  structures. The original structure is first; otherwise, the structures are in
  no particular order. The vector <tt>pC</tt> contains the negative
  log<sub>10</sub> concentrations of each <tt>ctlist</tt>; if the
  <tt>ctlist</tt> was not truncated (<i>e.g.</i> with <tt>limit</tt>) then the
  concentrations will sum to 1. <b>Note!</b> each member of <tt>ctlist</tt>
  (including the original state) will differ from the input <tt>ctab</tt>:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><tt>CTAB_A_HCOUNT</tt> and <tt>CTAB_A_CHARGE</tt> from state
    enumeration;</li>
    <li><tt>CTAB_B_BTYPE</tt> and <tt>CTAB_A_CHARGE</tt> from resonance
    recalculation;</li>
    <li><tt>CTAB_A_STEREO</tt> and <tt>CTAB_B_STEREO</tt> if
    <tt>updateStereo</tt> is enabled.</li>
  </ol>

<p>with other fields, atom and bond permutation remaining identical to the
  input <tt>ctab</tt>. <!--
The returned <tt>[I,J]</tt> vectors (each with the same length) define
the protonation state transition graph in edge list form.  Each state
transition <tt>k</tt> encodes the reaction
<nobr><tt>ctlist(I(k))</tt> &rightarrow; <tt>ctlist(J(k))</tt></nobr>
with state <tt>I(k)</tt> having one more hydrogen than state <tt>J(k)</tt>.
The graph is not necessarily connected (due to possible deletion of states in
the returned structures).

<pre>
[ctabs, graph] = <span class=
"fcndef">ctab_EnumerateProtomers</span> [ctab, opt]
</pre>

<p>Given a molecule <tt>ctab</tt> in <a href="ctabfcn.htm">CTAB</a> format,
  the <tt>ctab_EnumerateProtomers</tt> enumerates a list of molecular species
  which are related to the input by a sequence of transformations, which
  consist of some combination of tautomeric shifts, resonance interchanges,
  protonation and/or deprotonation reactions. The manner in which the
  enumeration is performed is stepwise, and the applicable range of
  transformations can be controlled to an extent by optional parameters. The
  enumeration is exhaustive, starting with the input structure, and terminating
  when no new results can be found, or the maximum limit is achieved.</p>

<p>Explicit hydrogen atoms are treated as inviolate honorary heavy atoms
  during the enumeration process, therefore in order for the enumeration to
  have any effect, the input representation must have some or all explicit
  hydrogen atoms subsumed into the <tt>CTAB_A_HCOUNT</tt> field. The implicit
  hydrogen fields must all be defined, i.e. non-negative, otherwise the
  enumeration function will fail. It is also inappropriate to provide aromatic
  bond types (<tt>CTAB_BT_ARO</tt>), which will not be properly handled.</p>

<p>One way to obtain such a suitable input is:</p>

<pre class="code">
svl&gt; ctab = ctab_Extract [akeys, [heavy:1, aro:0]]
</pre>

<p>The <tt>opt</tt> parameter is a tagged vector which allows various options
  to be controlled. Tautomer enumeration is always enabled.</p>
  <div class="indent">
    <dl>
      <dd></dd>
      <dt><tt>charge</tt> : <i>flag</i></dt>
      <dd>If non-zero then some limited forms of resonance-style charge
      migration is included in the enumeration steps, for example N(+)=C-N
      becomes interchangeable with N-C=N(+). While resonance-equivalent forms
      are filtered from the final output on the grounds of degeneracy, their
      presence during the enumeration process can give rise to derived
      tautomers or protomers, due to the possibility of different acidity and
      neighboring functional groups. The default is 0.</dd>
      <dd></dd>
      <dt><tt>titrate</tt> : <i>flag</i></dt>
      <dd>If non-zero then a number of transformations which involve adding or
      subtracting a proton to bases and acids respectively are allowed, which
      leads to the generation of protomers which have different overall charge
      and molecular formula, but the same heavy atom skeleton. While the
      eligible acids and bases are restricted to functional groups which have
      borderline pKa values, each of the protonation/deprotonation transforms
      is considered fully reversible, which leads to a combinatorial explosion
      of results when applied to molecules with a large number of protonic
      functional groups (e.g. many carboxylic acid or aliphatic amine
      functional groups). The default is 0.</dd>
      <dd></dd>
      <dt><tt>unique</tt> : <i>flag</i></dt>
      <dd>If on, then each proposed result of a transformation is converted to
      a canonically unique molecular representation, compared with those of the
      molecules already in the set, and discarded if already present. In this
      way, topologically degenerate results such as C(=O)OH and C(OH)=O will
      not be returned as two separate entries. If off, then the canonical
      reordering is not performed, and so the two attachment points for
      hydrogen on a carboxylic acid would be considered distinct results. The
      latter mode is particularly appropriate when the input molecule already
      has well defined 3D geometry, e.g. for ligands bound in an active site.
      The default is 1.</dd>
      <dd></dd>
      <dt><tt>limit</tt> : <i>number</i></dt>
      <dd>Because the enumeration process is stepwise, and the number of
      possible results is nominally exponential with respect to certain
      functional groups, the enumeration will be terminated when it reaches a
      predefined limit. The default is 100.</dd>
      <dd></dd>
      <dt><tt>pH</tt> : <i>number</i></dt>
      <dd>The pH of the aqueous environment. The default is 7.0.</dd>
      <dd></dd>
      <dt><tt>original</tt> : <i>flag</i></dt>
      <dd>If nonzero, the original structure will be retained when protomers
      are calculated. Otherwise, the original and all enumerated structures
      compete equally.</dd>
    </dl>
  </div>

<p>The first entry in the returned vector, <tt>ctabs</tt>, is an array of one
  or more molecular species, expressed in the CTAB format. The order of these
  results is arbitrary, except that the input molecule is always present, and
  always first. It is guaranteed that for each returned molecule, the atom
  number and atom ordering is identical. The hydrogen count, charge and bond
  order fields will be different for each result.</p>

<p>The second return parameter, <tt>graph</tt>, describes the manner in which
  the returned results are related by transformations, in neighbor-list format.
  The presence of an edge between two nodes implies that there is a protomer
  transformation between the two species.</p>
<a id="ctab_ProtomerUnique"></a>
<hr noshade="noshade" />

<pre>
idxlists = <span class="fcndef">ctab_ProtomerUnique</span> [ctablist, opt]
</pre>

<p>Given a list of molecular structures, determines which of them are
  tautomers or protomers of each other, and for each set of related structures,
  returns their indices.</p>

<p>The requirements for the input structures and options are the same as for
  <tt>ctab_EnumerateProtomers</tt> as described above, and the input may be
  composed of tautomers only or both tautomers and protomers.</p>

<p>Consider the molecules represented by the following SMILES strings:</p>

<pre class="code">
CC(=O)CCC
CC(O)=CCC
CC(O)CC=C
</pre>

<p>The first two molecules are keto-enol tautomers of each other, while the
  third molecule has the same molecular formula and heavy-atom skeleton, but it
  is not a tautomer of either of the first two. The indices returned by the
  function would be: <tt><span class="nobr">[[1, 2], 3]</span></tt>.</p>

<p>The function does not determine which tautomer or protomer should be used
  as the canonical reference, and the ordering within a group of indices has no
  special meaning. For efficiency purposes, this function should not be called
  with molecular species which have a different heavy-atom topology, since they
  cannot be protomers. When all input structures are the same, no protomer
  enumeration is necessary. Otherwise, protomer enumeration will have to be
  conducted for at least one of the input structures. The worst case scenario
  is that protomers will be enumerated for all input structures, which happens
  when none of the structures are protomers of each other.</p>

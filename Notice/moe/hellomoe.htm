<p>MOE provides a comprehensive and interactive visualization interface that
  permits multiple views of a molecular system:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="gui/mainwin.htm">MOE Window</a>. This is MOE's primary
      interface window, which opens on startup. Molecular systems are displayed
      in a variety of styles and can be selected and manipulated here. The MOE
      Window is the primary launch point for virtually all MOE applications.

<img src="hellomoe/mainwin.png" class="center" />
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="gui/se.htm">Sequence Editor</a>. This window displays a chain
      and residue representation of molecular systems that is well-suited for
      biopolymer applications.

<img src="hellomoe/se.png" class="center" />
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="gui/system.htm">System Manager</a>. This window lists the
      molecular objects loaded in MOE and controls their visibility, active
      state, and look.

<img src="hellomoe/sys_popup.png" alt=
      "System Manager" class="center" />
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="gui/atommgr.htm">Atom Manager</a>. This window displays
      properties of molecular objects loaded in MOE.

<img src="hellomoe/atommgr.png" class="center" />
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="../mdb/db.htm">Database Viewer</a>. A viewer for the display MOE
      databases and for the management of large collections of molecules or the
      many conformations of a single molecule.

<img src="hellomoe/db.png" class="center" />
    </li>
  </ul>

<p>The MOE interface can be either menu-driven or command-line based, or a
  combination of both. The <a href="gui/svlcommands.htm">SVL Commands
  window</a> displays the output generated by SVL commands and MOE
  applications. MOE also includes an assortment of management windows that
  control such features as geometric constraints, debugging, module loading,
  and task control.</p>

<p>MOE is a cross-platform application that has been designed to operate on
  desktop equipment without limiting either the size of the molecule under
  study or the kind of calculation that can be performed. Special purpose
  graphics workstations or terminals are not required to run MOE effectively.
  To see a full list of supported platforms, refer to <a href=
  "../install/install.htm">Installing and Running MOE and MOE/batch</a>.</p>

<p>MOE also provides access to shell commands and to <a href=
  "extprog.htm">external software programs</a> such as <a href=
  "extprog.htm#NAMD">NAMD</a>, <a href="extprog.htm#GOLD">GOLD</a>, <a href=
  "extprog.htm#MOPAC">MOPAC</a>, <a href="extprog.htm#PovRay">POV-Ray</a>, and
  <a href="gui/fileopen.htm#PSILODownload">PSILO</a>, among others, as well as
  a variety of <a href="extprog.htm#RelDatabases">relational databases</a>.</p>
<a id="Multi-Task"></a>
<h2>MOE's Multi-Tasking Environment</h2>

<p>MOE is multi-tasking, making it possible to have multiple commands active
  at once. For example, you can monitor the potential energy of a molecular
  system visually by coloring the atoms according to calculated forces,
  concurrently with the actual potential energy minimization task itself. Any
  number of applications can be open and run simultaneously.
<a id="Batch"></a>
</p>

<h2>MOE's Batch and Web Modes</h2>

<p>MOE can be run as a batch process. The application is called
  <b>MOE/batch</b>, and provides all of the features of MOE, including
  multi-tasking, but without any graphical interfaces.</p>

<p>MOE applications can be invoked in MOE/batch either directly from the
  MOE/batch command line or from within SVL scripts or programs to run as batch
  jobs. SVL scripts and programs can be used to automate workflow, and are
  convenient for performing repetitive tasks or for modifying options. The
  following applications will generate custom SVL batch files from the
  parameters provided in the graphical user interface (GUI):</p>

      <td>Ensemble sampling for calculating average properties.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

<p>MOE/batch is used when web access to MOE is desired. <b>MOE/web</b> is a
  gateway between a web browser and the batch version of MOE. Its purpose is to
  allow distributed access via networked computers to custom SVL programs or
  MOE built-in applications. The MOE distribution includes a number of <a href=
  "../moeweb_apps/moeweb_intro.htm">MOE/web applications</a>.</p>

<p>For more information on MOE/batch, please see <a href=
  "../install/install.htm">Installing and Running MOE and MOE/batch</a>. For
  more information on MOE/web, please see <a href=
  "../install/web_inst.htm">Installing and Running MOE/web</a>.
<a id="Multi-Processor"></a>
</p>

<h2>MOE's Multi-Processor Mode (SMP)</h2>

<p><b>MOE/cluster (MOE/smp)</b> (Scalable Multi-Processor) is an enhancement
  to MOE and MOE/batch, allowing several MOE processes to cooperate on
  large-scale distributed computing jobs. A single MOE session can harness the
  power of a heterogeneous collection of computers, including laptops,
  workstations, and multi-processor supercomputers, each running a different
  operating system, including various flavors of both UNIX and Windows.</p>

<p>The following computation-intensive applications in MOE are designed to
  run in parallel if MOE/cluster (MOE/smp) is enabled:</p>
  <table class="noborder">

<h1>MOE Graphical User Interface (GUI) Basics</h1>

<p>This section gives a brief description of the basic objects used by
  MOE's graphical user interface (GUI).
<a id="Command_Line_Interface_(CLI)"></a>
<a id="CLI"></a>
</p>

<h2>Command Line Interface (CLI)</h2>

<p>The <i>Command Line Interface</i>, or CLI, is used to invoke commands and
  SVL routines as well as to enter SVL statements and expressions.</p>
  <img src="hellomoe/cli.png" alt="CLI in MOE" class="center" />

<p>In fact, all MOE menu and command actions are mapped to SVL routines, and
  can be initiated directly from the CLI. For more information, see the
  <a href="gui/svlcommands.htm">SVL Commands window</a>.</p>

<h2>
<a id="Prompts"></a>
Prompts</h2>

<p>When certain commands are selected, the CLI changes to a prompt area. For
  instance, choosing <span class="nobr"><b>MOE | Edit | Measure |
  Distances</b></span> in the MOE Window changes the CLI to an atom editing
  prompt as shown in the figure below:</p>
  <img src="hellomoe/meter.png" alt="Editing Prompt in MOE" class="center" />

<p>In addition to the MOE Window, both the <a href="gui/se.htm">Sequence
  Editor</a> and the <a href="../mdb/db.htm">Database Viewer</a> make use of
  prompts in the CLI. Pressing <tt>Esc</tt> or the red 'X' removes the
  prompt and returns the CLI to its normal state.</p>

<p>In MOE 2012.10, prompts do not stack. When two prompts are raised in
  succession, the invoking the second prompt will cause the first one to be
  canceled. If, during prompting, you wish to enter an SVL command, use the SVL
  Commands window, or another CLI in the system (e.g. in the Sequence Editor);
  while one CLI is occupied by a prompt, other CLIs function as usual.</p>

<p>Finally, it is possible to add a CLI widget to any panel or window in MOE.
  For more information on widgets see the <a href=
  "../svl/svlgui/wt_intro.htm">SVL Window Toolkit</a>.</p>
<a id="Menus"></a>
<h2>Menus</h2>
<a id="Menu_Bars"></a>
<h3>
<a id="MenuBars">Menu Bars</a></h3>

<p>A menu bar appearing at the top of each MOE window displays the pull-down
  menus associated with the window. The look of menu bars may differ slightly
  from platform to platform. <a id="Pull-Down_Menus"></a>
</p>

<h3>
<a id="PullDownMenus">Pull-Down Menus</a></h3>

<p>To open a pull-down menu, click on its name or type in its
  <em>mnemonic</em>. Mnemonics are key combinations used to open and navigate
  pull-down menus without using the mouse. Each menu has one of its letters
  underlined; pressing this key in conjunction with the <tt>Alt</tt> key is
  referred to as the mnemonic. For example, you can open the File menu by
  pressing <tt>Alt+F</tt>. This has the same effect as clicking on File in the
  menu bar. Once open, the up and down arrow keys and mnemonics (in this case,
  solely the underlined letter suffices) may be used to traverse the menu. The
  left and right arrow keys can be used to open successive menus in the menu
  bar.</p>

<p>To close a menu, press <tt>Esc</tt> or click away from the menu. The rest
  of the application is unresponsive to events until the menu is serviced.
  Menus are automatically closed when windows are resized, repositioned, or
  hidden.</p>

<a id="Menu_Entries_or_Commands"></a>
<h3>
<a id="MenuEntries"></a>
Menu Entries or Commands</h3>

<p>Menu entries (also called commands) can be selected by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Clicking on the menu entry and releasing the mouse button. You can also
    perform the same operation in a single click-drag-release operation.</li>
    <li>Pressing <tt>Return</tt> after having traversed (using arrow keys) an
    open menu.</li>
    <li>Typing the mnemonic of a menu item in an open menu.</li>
    <li>Typing the keyboard accelerator (described below).</li>
  </ul>

<p>Menu entries are greyed when a menu is context-sensitive and the action
  corresponding to the command would have no effect or is not permitted.</p>
  <table class="noborder">
    <tr>
      <td><img src="hellomoe/accel.png" /></td>
      <td>
<a id="Keyboard_Accelerators"></a>
Certain
        menu commands provide accelerators, or <em>hot keys</em>, for quick
        access. Accelerators appear to the right of their corresponding menu
        command, and are usually of the form <tt>Ctrl+key</tt>. An accelerator
        can be used anywhere in a window, but only while the window in question
        is active (i.e. has the focus). The following hot keys are noteworthy:

        The color chooser widget allows for selecting from a standard palette
        or for specifying a custom color. When opened, the color chooser shows
        a bank of preset standard colors along with recently-used colors.
        <img src="hellomoe/color_widget1.png" class="center" />

<p>Pressing the arrow button pulls down the custom color selector. A
        custom color can be chosen either by dragging the crosshair over the
        color chart</p>
        <img src="hellomoe/color_crosshair.png" class="center" />

<p>and then adjusting the luminosity (intensity) by dragging the
        luminosity pointer,</p>
        <img src="hellomoe/color_pointer.png" class="center" />

<p>or by specifying the color numerically in the RGB (Red-Green-Blue)
        or HSL (Hue-Saturation-Luminosity) text fields at the bottom. The
        values can be given in either decimal or hexadecimal format (in the
        latter case they must be prefixed by <tt>0x</tt>) and are clipped to
        the range [0..255] <span class="nobr">(<tt>[0..0xFF]</tt>)</span>. To
        use hexadecimal format, the <b>Display Hex</b> option must be on.</p>

<p>Certain applications have transparency enabled in the color widget.
        Transparency values are in the range [0..255], where 0 is opaque.</p>
        <img src="hellomoe/color_trans.png" class="center" />

<p>The custom color is shown in the <b>New</b> box, which updates
        dynamically, and can be compared with the <b>Current</b> color,
        displayed immediately below.</p>

<p>Pressing <b>OK</b> puts the new color into effect and adds it to the
        front of the <b>Recent Colors</b> bank. <b>Cancel</b> will leave the
        color chart in the current state, but will not put the new color into
        effect.</p>

        A listbox displays a set of strings in single- or multi-column mode.
        The list entries can be selecting using the mouse. Scrollbars are used
        to navigate long lists; the scroll mouse can also be used to scroll
        through a list. If a list has a header and each list entry comprises a
        number of fields, the header may provide a heading for each field.
        Clicking on a field heading results in the list being sorted according
        to that field.

<p>In MOE, there are single-select lists and multi-select lists:</p>
        <ol type="a">
          <li><b>Single-select lists</b> allow the selection of a single entry
          at a time. In other words, clicking on a new item automatically
          deselects the currently selected item. Depending on the list,
          double-clicking on the selected item might perform an action.</li>
          <li>
            <b>Multi-select lists</b> allow the simultaneous selection of
            several items in the list. Multi-select lists are used for
            operations, such as choosing QuaSAR descriptors, that allow the
            user to select more than one item.

<p>There are two types of multi-select lists:</p>

<p>In the first type (referred to as multi-select style 1):</p>
            <ul>
              <li>To select one or more items, click on them. This is known as
              additive selection.</li>
              <li>To deselect an item, click on it again. This toggles its
              selection state.</li>
              <li>To select a range of entries, click on the first item then
              press <tt>Shift</tt> as you click on the second.</li>
              <li>To clear the selection, press <tt>Ctrl</tt> and click
              anywhere in the list.</li>
            </ul>

<p>In the second type (referred to as multi-select style 2):</p>
            <ul>
              <li>To select an item, click on it. However, this will deselect
              any other selected items.</li>
              <li>To toggle the selection state of an item (or select
              non-consecutive items), press <tt>Ctrl</tt>-click.</li>
              <li>To select a range of items, press <tt>Shift</tt>-click.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>

<p>A List popup menu is displayed by placing the cursor over the list
        area or header and pressing the mouse popup button. The List popup
        includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Clear Selection</li>
          <li>Select All</li>
          <li>Invert Selection</li>

        The material chooser widget allows for selecting from a standard
        palette or for specifying custom material properties. When opened, the
        pull-down shows a bank of preset standard materials along with sliders
        for customization. The widget has different options:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Front and Back</b>. In this mode, the widget maintains
          separate material properties for the front and back faces of a
          graphic object. This is useful when rendering open graphical objects
          such as surfaces. When this mode is disabled, the widget specifies
          properties for a single material.</li>
          <li><b>Transparency</b>. With this option, the widget can be used to

        </ul>In all cases, the widget can be used to set the <i>shading</i>,

        the <tt>Saved</tt> button from the material palette. The <b>Reset</b>
        button resets the widget to its value when the pull-down was opened.

<h2>File Selection Box</h2>

<p>The file selection box (FSB) is used to specify one or more files or
  directories. There are two versions of the FSB, a single file selection and a
  multiple file selection, differing only in the presence, in the latter case,
  of a second list in which selected files are accumulated. In this section,
  the single FSB will be described in detail; the differences to the
  multi-select FSB are presented at the end.</p>
<a id="Single_File_Selection"></a>
<h2>Single File Selection</h2>

<p>The single file selection FSB comprises a files list, above which are
  navigational controls and a directory path area, and below which are a
  filename textfield and filter pulldown.</p>
  <img src="hellomoe/fileopen.png" alt="File Selection Box" class="center" />

<a id="cwd"></a>
<p><b>Navigation.</b> Browsing the file tree can be accomplished in different
  ways:</p>

<div class="floatright">
  <img src="hellomoe/fsb_dirpath.png" alt="Directory path" class="icon" />
  <p class="caption">Directory Path</p>

  <img src="hellomoe/fsb_favorites.png" alt="Favorites" class="icon" />
  <p class="caption">Favorites</p>
</div>

  <ul>
    <li><img src="hellomoe/fsb_arrows.png" class="icon" />
    <b>Arrows.</b> The forward and back buttons navigate the history of visited
    directories. The FSB is opened in the current working directory (CWD).
    Pressing the back (left) arrow will visit the directory last visited in
    the most recent previously-opened FSB.</li>
    <li><img src="hellomoe/fsb_star.png" class="icon" />
    <b>Favorites.</b> The top row of the Favorites menu contains shortcuts for
    <tt>$MOE</tt>, <tt>$HOME</tt>, the working folder (also referred to as the
    current working directory (CWD)), <tt>$DOWNLOADS</tt>, <tt>$DESKTOP</tt>,
    and the Windows Favorites directory (Windows only). The second row
    contains drive letters, if any. The rest of the menu is populated by
    recently visited directories.</li>
    <li><b>Directory Path.</b> The currently-listed directory is detailed in
    the directory path area. To ascend the directory tree, press the
    appropriate component of the directory path. Pressing an arrow in the
    directory path drops down a menu of all subdirectories of the parent
    directory. If the subdirectories are sufficiently numerous, the menu is
    paged.</li>
    <li><b>Directory Path Textfield.</b> Clicking in the empty area of the
    directory path field opens the directory path textfield into which a
    directory path can be typed. Pressing <tt>Enter</tt>, or, equivalently, the
    green checkmark, changes to the specified directory and closes the
    textfield. The red X quits the textfield display, as does pressing
    <tt>Esc</tt>.</li>
    <li><b>CWD.</b> Sets the current working directory to the currently browsed
    folder. The <i>current working directory</i>, as returned by the SVL
    <a href="../svl/fcnref/cd.htm">cd</a> function, is the directory which is
    read from and written to by default, when no file path information is
    specified.</li>
  </ul>

<p><b>File Selection.</b> Selecting a file can be accomplished as
  follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Files List</b>. Clicking in the list will select a file. The name
    will appear in the filename textfield below; the textfield is automatically
    sync'ed to the file list selection. When there is a file selected,
    pressing OK causes the FSB to trigger (return its value). Double-clicking
    in the list has the same effect.</li>
    <li><b>File textfield.</b> Entering the name of a file causes that file to
    be selected. Pressing <tt>Return</tt> causes the FSB to trigger. Filename
    completion is activated with the <tt>Tab</tt> key.</li>
  </ul>

<p><b>Filters.</b> The Filter menu to the right of the File textfield may
  contain common filter groups by name (e.g. <tt>Sequence Files</tt>), and has
  a textfield into which a name pattern may be entered. The filter is applied
  to the displayed directory listing, and all files matching the search pattern
  are displayed. The non-matching files are hidden.</p>

<p><b>Sorting.</b> The files list may be sorted by name, type, size, or date
  by pressing the header field titles. Successive presses to the same field
  header will toggle between ascending and descending sort order.</p>

<p><b>FSB Popup.</b> Right-clicking in the FSB raises a popup menu containing
  the following items:</p>
  <div class="floatleft"><img src="hellomoe/fsb_popup.png" alt=
  "FSB popup" class="floatleft" /></div>
  <table class="noborder">
    <tr>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Dot-names</b></td>
      <td>If enabled, files and folders with names beginning with a dot
      ('.') will be displayed in the list.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Save Sort Order</b></td>

      retained.</td>

      <td>Restore the list order to its initial state.</td>

  </table><!--

<p>
The single file selection FSB includes the current path name as well as
a text field and two lists, one of which displays directories and the
other which displays files in the current path.
</p>

<p>
The text field popup menu lists the most recently used directories
during a session. Selecting one of the items points the FSB to the
specified directory. (On startup, this popup is loaded with relevant MOE
directories. Users may pre-load their own using the
<tt>recentDirectories</tt> RC configuration setting.)
</p>

<p>
To select a directory, double-click on its name or type it in the text
field and press <tt>Return</tt>.
</p>

<p>
To select a file:

<ul>
  <li>Double-click on a file in the file list, or</li>
  <li>Type a filename in the text field and press either <tt>Return</tt> or
    <b>OK</b>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The FSB provides filename completion in the text field if you press the
<tt>Tab</tt> key. The filename will complete up to the point of
ambiguity.  The text field can also be used to specify a filter.  For
example, to display only files with extension <tt>.svl</tt>, type
<tt>*.svl</tt> in the text field and press <tt>Return</tt>.  Type
<tt>*</tt> to return to a full directory listing.
</p>

-->
<a id="Multiple_File_Selection"></a>
<h2>Multiple File Selection</h2>

<p>Some applications allow several files to be processed at the same time. In
  these cases, a multiple file selection box is offered. The multiple file
  selection box allows you to create a <i>list</i> of files to be used. Files
  can be added and removed from the list before returning from the selection
  box.</p>

<img src="hellomoe/fsb2.png" alt="Multiple File Selection Box" class="center" />

<p>The multiple file selection box functions in the same manner as the single
  file selection box with the exception that when a file is chosen it is placed
  in the list. Once the list is complete, press <b>OK</b> to return the list of
  files.

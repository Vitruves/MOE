<p>The SVL Commands Window is opened by choosing Commands from the Window
  menu in the <a href="mainwin.htm">MOE Window</a>, <a href="se.htm">Sequence
  Editor</a> or <a href="../../mdb/db.htm">Database Viewer</a>. It can also be
  raised by pressing the <b>SVL</b> button at the top right of the MOE Window
  or Sequence Editor. The SVL Commands Window contains an SVL command line
  interface (CLI) that is used for inputting SVL commands; the CLI is also
  available in the primary MOE windows, but hidden by default. It is made
  available when <tt>Space</tt> is pressed while the focus is in the respective
  primary window.</p>
<a id="Display_Area"></a>

<h2>Display Area</h2>

<p>The upper section of the SVL Commands Window echoes whatever is typed at
  <strong>any</strong> of the CLIs (command line interfaces) in MOE and
  displays the SVL return values of the entered expressions unless they are
  assignments or terminated by semi-colons.</p>

<img src="svlcommands/cli.png" alt=
  "SVL Commands Window" class="center" />

<p>Printed output generated by SVL write functions such as <tt>print</tt>,
  <tt>pr</tt> and <tt>write</tt>, whether invoked from the command line or from
  within an SVL program, appears here. Many of MOE's built-in applications
  use these functions to print reports or status information to the SVL
  Commands window. Applications that allow for saving a report to a file will
  usually output the report contents in this window if no save file has been
  specified. In general, commands entered at the CLI are coupled with an SVL
  print command so that their return values are automatically sent to the
  output area of the SVL Commands Window. Note that in all cases a null return
  value is not displayed. If CLI Color Annotation is enabled in the
  <a href="../../appendix/settings.htm#Miscellaneous">
  Configuration Options</a>, SVL commands are colored blue and errors red.
  </p>

<img src="svlcommands/svlpopup.png" alt=
  "Popup Menu in SVL Commands Window" class="floatright" />

<p>The scrollbar will scroll the output of the current session up to a
  predefined number of lines. You can control this value using the SVL Output
  History and SVL Command History parameters in the Miscellaneous page of the
  <a href="../../appendix/settings.htm#Miscellaneous">Configuration
  Options</a>.</p>

<p>The font size in the output display area can be changed using a popup
  menu, which is opened by pressing the <a href=
  "mouse.htm#MousePopupButton">mouse popup button</a> over the output area.</p>

<h2>Command Line Interface (CLI)</h2>

<p>Located at the bottom of the window, as well as in the <a href=
  "mainwin.htm">MOE Window</a>, <a href="se.htm">Sequence Editor</a>, and
  <a href="../../mdb/db.htm">Database Viewer</a>, the command line interface
  (CLI) is where SVL commands are entered and issued. All SVL commands can be
  issued at the command line. Looping and if-then-else constructs are also
  permitted. The following, however, are <b>not</b> allowed:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Function declarations or definitions</li>
    <li>Constant declarations (<tt>const</tt>)</li>
    <li>Local or static variable declarations (<tt>local</tt>,
    <tt>static</tt>)</li>
  </ul>

<p>The following keystrokes allow you to retrieve and edit commands entered
  in the command line:</p>

<a id="Search_Operator"></a>
<h3>
<a id="SearchOperator">Search Operator</a></h3>

<p>A search operator is available for retrieving commands from the command
  history. To search for a pattern, type <tt>#/pat</tt> (no preceding white
  space or characters) in the CLI. The pattern will be matched against the
  commands in the history list, beginning with the most recent. A failed search
  is indicated by a beep. The search line itself is not saved into the command
  history.</p>

<p>After typing your query, if you press <tt>Enter</tt>, the most recent
  command matching the pattern will be immediately executed. Pressing
  <tt>Shift+Enter</tt>, on the other hand, will display the command at the CLI,
  allowing you to view and modify the command prior to executing it.</p>

<a id="Filename_Constants_and_Symbols_Completion"></a>
<h3>
<a id="FileNameCompletion">Filename, Constants
  and Symbols Completion</a></h3>

<p>At the CLI, enter a single quote followed by the first few letters of the
  filename, constant or symbol name and press <tt>Tab</tt>. MOE proceeds to
  match the letters against all files in the current directory (or, if a
  directory path has been provided, in the specified directory), all defined
  constants and all defined symbol names. If more than one match is found, it
  will fill in the letters until it reaches a point of ambiguity. To continue
  with the completion, you must then supply more letters and press <tt>Tab</tt>
  again. MOE will beep if it reaches a condition of ambiguity or does not find
  any matches.</p>

<a id="Command_Completion"></a>
<h3>
<a id="CommandCompletion">Command
  Completion</a></h3>

<p>Command completion is performed in the same way as filename completion
  (with the <tt>Tab</tt> key) except that the command name is not enclosed in
  single quotes.</p>

<a id="Command_History"></a>
<a id="History"></a>
<h3>Command History</h3>

<p>The CLI maintains a history of issued commands. The up and down arrow
  keys, or the keystroke combinations <tt>Ctrl+P</tt> and <tt>Ctrl+N</tt> can
  be used to scroll through previous commands in the command history list. All
  CLIs share the same history buffer, i.e. there is only one history buffer.
  The size of the history buffer can be configured in the Miscellaneous page of
  the <a href="../../appendix/settings.htm#Miscellaneous">Configuration
  Options</a>.</p>

<p>Specific commands can be recalled from the Command History by entering
  <tt>#num</tt> at the CLI, where <tt>num</tt> is the command number as shown
  by the SVL Command <a class="svl" href=
  "../../svl/fcnref/logfile.htm">history</a>. Similar to when using a search
  operator, after typing your query, if you press <tt>Enter</tt>, the command
  at that history position will be immediately executed. Pressing
  <tt>Shift+Enter</tt>, on the other hand, will display the command at the CLI,
  allowing you to view and modify the command prior to executing it.</p>
<a id="Logfile"></a>
<h3>SVL Logfile</h3>

<p>The SVL Command <a class="svl" href=
  "../../svl/fcnref/logfile.htm">logfile</a> allows the contents of the SVL
  Commands window, both commands and SVL return values, to be written to a
  file.</p>
<a id="Cut_Copy_and_Paste"></a>
<a id="Cut"></a>
<h3>Cut, Copy and Paste</h3>

<p>Text in the display area is non-editable but can be copied using the Copy
  To Clipboard option in the popup menu. The highlighted text is copied to the
  clipboard which can then be pasted to the command line or into a text editor,
  for example. Text can be highlighted by dragging with the <tt>Left</tt>
  mouse button. A selection can be extended with a <tt>Shift+Left</tt> click
  on the end point. The text of a complete line (including wrapping) is
  selected with a <tt>Shift+Left</tt> double click. The popup menu
  can be used to select all text.</p>

<p>In the CLI, text is copied using <tt>Ctrl+Insert</tt>, cut using
  <tt>Shift+Del</tt>, or pasted from the clipboard using <tt>Shift+Insert</tt>.
  <tt>Ctrl+X</tt>, <tt>Ctrl+C</tt> and <tt>Ctrl+V</tt> will also work for cut,
  copy and paste, respectively. On UNIX machines, middle-clicking in the CLI
  pastes highlighted text from any window to the CLI.</p>

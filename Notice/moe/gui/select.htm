<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>The Atom Selector and Residue Selector panels offer an extensive array of
  selection controls and the ability to combine selections using logical
  operators. These panels may be called into play when the built-in menu
  commands of the <a href="mainwin.htm#Selecting">MOE Window</a> and
  <a href="se.htm#SelectingMolecularObjects">Sequence Editor</a> are
  insufficient. For basic selection tasks, the MOE and SE menu commands provide
  a variety of pre-defined atom and residue selection commands such as ligand
  and pocket atom selection, atom selection by element, chirality, and protein
  properties, or chain, residue, and child atom selection with given
  properties. The Atom Selector panel additionally supports such selection
  criteria as ring connectivity, atom name, accessibility, and pharmacophoric
  type, among others, and the Residue Selector panel such criteria as amino
  acid classes and pattern matching. Additional flexibility is gained through
  the use of named sets, which are collections of molecular objects identified
  by a unique name. Both panels support the use of such sets.</p>
<a id="Named_Sets"></a>
<a id="NamedSets"></a>
<h1>Named Sets</h1>

<p>In MOE, molecular data can be managed as named sets or <i>collections</i>.
  A collection comprises any mixture of atom, residue, and chain keys, and has
  a unique associated name. The selection panels allow named sets to be
  manipulated using the <b>Named Set</b> field. In the <b>Atom Selector</b>
  only atom keys will be added to a named set and in the <b>Residue
  Selector</b> only residue keys will be added to a named set. The atom set
  further allows for 10 predefined sets to be created.</p>

<p>Named sets are displayed in three locations in the selection panels.</p>
  <ol type="i">
    <li>
      <b>The option menu at the top</b>.

<img src="select/aset.png" alt="Atom Selection" class="center" />

<p>These menus define the set of objects to be included in the selection
      operations. If any named sets are defined then they will appear in the
      menu. When chosen, only the objects (and child objects) in the chosen set
      will be used for the selection.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>The shortcut menu in the Named Set text field</b>.

<img src="select/namedset.png" alt="Named Set" class="center" />

<p>The <b>Named Set</b> field is used to create new or overwrite existing
      sets. The shortcut will show any currently named sets.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>The Sets: menu in the selection button area</b>.

<img src="select/sets.png" alt="Sets" class="center" />

<p>The <b>Sets</b> menu located among the selection buttons of the panel
      is used to operate on the objects in the set itself. The operation
      performed will depend on the <i>defined set</i> and the <i>operation</i>
      chosen.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

<p>Named sets are stored with the system and will be reinstated when the
  molecule file is reopened. Empty sets are not allowed, thus, creating a named
  set with no objects is equivalent to deleting the set from the system.</p>
<a id="Defining_the_Selection_Set"></a>
<a id="DefinedSet"></a>
<h1>Defining the Selection Set</h1>

<p>The Atom Selector and Residue Selector panels generally operate on a
  restricted set of atoms or residues called the <i>defined object set</i>.
  When a button is pressed, only the objects (or child objects) will be used.
  If, say, a selection of all Carbon atoms is chosen, only those carbon atoms
  located in the defined set will be operated upon.</p>

<p>Defining this restricted set is done through the options at the top of the
  panel using a combination of the option menu and the checkboxes. The
  intersection of all chosen restrictions will define the set.</p>
<a id="The_Defined_Atom_Set"></a>
<a id="AtomSet"></a>
<h3>The Defined Atom Set</h3>

<p>The defined atom set is specified by the following controls:</p>

<table class="noborder">
  <tr>
	<td><b>All Atoms</b></td>
	<td>Include all atoms in the system.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td><b>Selected Residues</b></td>
	<td>Restrict operations to atoms whose parent residue is selected.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td><b>Named Set</b></td>
	<td>Restrict operations to atoms in the set or to child atoms of
	residue and chain objects in the set.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td><b>Selected Chains</b></td>
	<td>Restricts operations to atoms whose parent chain is selected.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td><b>Visible Atoms</b></td>
	<td>Restricts operations to visible atoms.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>If all checkboxes are turned off and <b>All Atoms</b> is specified then
  the defined atom set is all the atoms in the system.</p>
<a id="The_Defined_Residue_Set"></a>
<a id="ResidueSet"></a>
<h3>The Defined Residue Set</h3>

<p>The defined residue set is specified using the following controls:</p>
<table class="noborder">
  <tr>
	<td><b>All Chains</b></td>
	<td>Include all residues in all chains.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td><b>Selected Chains</b></td>
	<td>Restricts operations to residues whose parent chain is
	selected.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td><b>Named Set</b></td>
	<td>Restricts operations to residues in the set and to child residues
	of chain objects in the set.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td><b>Residues with<br />
	Visible Atoms</b></td>
	<td>Restricts operations to residues with at least one atom visible in
	the MOE Window.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td><b>Nonempty Residues</b></td>
	<td>Restricts operations to residues with at least one atom.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>If all checkboxes are turned off and <b>All Chains</b> is chosen, then the
  defined residue set is all the residues in the system.</p>
<a id="The_Selection_Operation"></a>
<a id="Operation"></a>
<h1>The Selection Operation</h1>

<p>In both selection panels, the <b>Operation</b> radio buttons are used to
  combine consecutive selections.</p>
<table class="noborder">
  <tr>
	<td><b>or</b></td>
	<td>Add the objects satisfying the new criteria to the current
	selection set.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td><b>and</b></td>
	<td>Select the intersection between the objects satisfying the new
	criteria and the previous selection set. Deselect any objects not in
	this set.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td><b>deselect</b></td>
	<td>Deselect the objects satisfying the new criteria.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td><b>replace</b></td>
	<td>Clear the current selection and replace it with the objects
	satisfying the new criteria.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<a id="The_Atom_Selector"></a>
<a id="AtomSelector"></a>
<h1>The Atom Selector</h1>

<p>The Atom Selector allows complex selection operations to be performed on
  sets of atoms. From this panel you can perform logical operations on
  selection sets, as well as select atoms based on specific properties,
  substructure or proximity. The Atom Selector is opened from the MOE Window
  <a href="sel_ui.htm">Selection Prompter</a>. Choose
  <span class="menu">MOE | Select | Selector</span>
  and in the Selection Prompter interface, press the <b>UI</b> button. The
  following panel will open:</p>

<img src="select/aselect.png" alt="Atom Selector" class="center" />

<p>The buttons to the right of the <b>Atom</b> definition controls operate
  upon the defined atom set, as follows:</p>

<table class="noborder">
  <tr>
	<td><b>All</b></td>
	<td>Select all atoms within the defined atom set.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td><b>Clear</b></td>
	<td>Deselect all atom within the defined atom set.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td><b>Fixed</b></td>
	<td>Select all fixed atoms within the defined atom set.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td><b>Hidden</b></td>
	<td>Select all hidden atoms within the defined atom set.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td><b>Invert</b></td>
	<td>Toggle the selection state of all atom within the defined atom
	set.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td><b>Visible</b></td>
	<td>Select all visible atoms within the defined atom set.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The <b>Current Set</b> label displays the number of atoms currently
  selected in the system.</p>

<p>The buttons at the bottom of the panel, <b>View, Hide, Show</b>, operate
  on the entire current selection set ignoring the defined atom set.
  <b>View</b> centers all the selected atoms in the 3D rendering area.
  <b>Hide</b> hides all the selected atoms and <b>Show</b> makes the selected
  atoms visible.</p>
<a id="Predefined_Atom_Sets"></a>
<a id="PredefinedAtomSets"></a>
<h2>Predefined Atom Sets</h2>

<p>You can save and restore up to ten different <i>system</i> atom sets using
  the <b>Save Set/Load Set</b> buttons. Loading an atom set will restore the
  selection set and combine it with the previous selection set according to the
  chosen logical operation. The saved selection set remains in memory as long
  as it is not overwritten. A bold label indicates the set currently has a
  value.</p>
<a id="Atom_Selection_Buttons"></a>
<a id="AtomSelectionButtons"></a>
<h2>Atom Selection Buttons</h2>

<p>The selection buttons are grouped together based on property. You can
  select by <b>Element</b>, <b>Name</b>, <b>SMILES</b> or use a selection from
  one of the pages located in the pager: <b>Accessibility</b>, <b>Chiral</b>,
  <b>Connectivity</b>, <b>Geometry</b>, <b>General</b>, <b>Pharmacophore</b>,
  and <b>Protein</b>.</p>

<table class="noborder">

<a id="ResidueSelector"></a>
<h1>The Residue Selector Panel</h1>

<p>The Residue Selector allows the selection of residues based on specific
  criteria. Selections can be made on residue name (e.g. Alanine), structure
  (e.g. helix, 4-turn), chemical class (e.g. hydrophobic, acidic), search
  strings, as well as other methods. The selection operations permit the
  intersection or union of two selection sets or entire replacement of the
  current selection set.</p>

<p>The Residue Selector is opened from the Sequence Editor <a href=
  "sel_ui.htm">Selection Prompter</a>. Choose
  <span class="menu">SE | Select | Selector</span>
  and in the Selection Prompter interface, press the <b>UI</b> button. The
  following panel will open:</p>

<img src="select/rselect.png" alt="Residue Selector" class="center" />

<p>The buttons to the right of the residue definition controls operate upon
  the defined residue set, as follows:</p>

<table class="noborder">
  <tr>
	<td><b>All</b></td>
	<td>Select all residues within the defined residue set.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td><b>Clear</b></td>
	<td>Deselect all residues within the defined residue set.</td>

	<td>Toggle the selection state of all residues within the defined
	residue set.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td><b>Atoms</b></td>
	<td>Select all visible atoms that are children of residues within the
	defined residue set.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The <b>Select Atoms</b> button at the bottom of the panel is independent
  of the <i>defined residue set</i>. Pressing this button will select the atoms
  of the currently selected residues.</p>
<a id="Extending_the_Selection"></a>
<a id="Extend"></a>
<h2>Extending the Selection</h2>

<p>Extending a selection means expanding the current set of selected residues
  according to particular rules defined by the extend operations. The currently
  selected residues are the basis for the extend operation, and any additional
  residues can only be selected if they are within the defined residue set.
  Each extend operation defines a rule that determines how additional residues
  will be selected:</p>

<table class="noborder">
  <tr>
	<td><b>Column</b></td>
	<td>All residues that are in the defined residue set and are also in
	the same column as at least one currently selected residue.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td><b>Subunit Column</b></td>
	<td>All residues that are in the defined residue set and are also in
	the same column and same subunit as at least one currently
	selected residue.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td><b>Domain</b></td>
	<td>Residues that are in the defined residue set and are also in the
	same protein domain as a currently selected residue.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td><b>Secondary Structure</b></td>
	<td>Residues that are in the defined residue set and are also in the
	same secondary structure segment as a currently selected residue.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td><b>Radius</b></td>
	<td>Residues that are in the defined residue set and that are located
	within the specified radius (in angstroms) of a currently selected
	residue. The text field contains a shortcut for common values, however,
	any value may be entered. Press <b>Proximity</b> to perform the extend
	operation.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td><b>Neighbor</b></td>
	<td>Residues that are in the defined residue set and that are
	neighboring a currently selected residue in terms of the residue
	sequence. The text field permits specifying by how many neighbors on
	each side to extend. If <b>Columns</b> is on, gaps are taken into
	account, otherwise they are ignored.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<a id="ResidueOperation"></a>
<h2>Residue Selection Operation</h2>

<p>In addition to setting the defined residue set, the operation may also be
  changed when using any of the buttons in the <b>Select</b> section of the
  panel.</p>
<a id="Residue_Selection_Buttons"></a>
<a id="ResidueSelectionButtons"></a>
<h2>Residue Selection Buttons</h2>

<p>The buttons available for selecting and deselecting residues are grouped
  into several categories as outlined in the following sections.</p>
<a id="Selecting_by_Residue_Name"></a>
<a id="ResidueName"></a>
<h3>Selecting by Residue Name</h3>

<p>To select residues by name use the groups of buttons located in the
  <b>Name</b> pager. If none of the buttons contain the desired residue name,
  the <b>Other</b> text field can be used to enter an arbitrary name. The
  <b>Name</b> pager contains the following pages of buttons:</p>
  <table class="noborder">
      <tr>
        <td><b>Amino Acids</b></td>
        <td>
          Selecting by amino acid types can be done using either the single
          letter or the three letter amino acid names. The <b>Single Letter
          Residues</b> toggle controls which buttons will be shown. Included in
          this list is <b>UNK</b> for <i>unknown</i> three letter codes. The
          three letter codes correspond to the values returned by the svl
          function <span class="svl">rName</span>.

<p>The single letter codes correspond to the values returned by the
          svl function <span class="svl">Seq_NameToLetter</span>.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Nucleic Acid</b></td>
        <td>Nucleic acid residues are selected based on name alone. For
        example, if a non-nucleic acid residue has the name 'a', then
        it will also be selected.</td>

        <td>
          This field can be used to enter a single name which will be searched
          for in the defined residue set. Often it is desirable to combine a
          residue name with its UID value in order to more precisely specify a
          residue. Several examples of how input will be interpreted are as
          follows:

<h3>Selecting by Pattern</h3>

<p>Residues can be selected based on an amino acid residue search pattern. To
  do so, enter the search string, a sequence of characters designating the
  sub-sequence to be found within the current system, in the text field and
  press <b>Pattern</b>. Residues matching the pattern and within the defined
  residue set are selected or deselected (depending on the Operation). For
  example, the sequence <tt>gx</tt> will select all pairs of consecutive
  residues in which the first residue is a glycine.</p>

<p>The standard IUPAC one-letter codes for amino acids are used. The patterns
  are case-insensitive.</p>

<p>Wildcards and variations of a sequence can be specified using the
  following characters:</p>
  <center>
    <table class="titlebar">
      <tr>
        <th>Wildcard</th>

        <td width="10%"><tt>x<br />
        ?</tt></td>
        <td>Wildcard matching exactly 1 character.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><tt>[]</tt></td>
        <td>Indicates a set of matchable characters. For example,
        <tt>[ALT]</tt> can match Ala or Leu or Thr.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><tt>{}<br />
        [^ ]</tt></td>
        <td>Set of characters which must not be matched. For example,
        <tt>{AM}</tt> or <tt>[^AM]</tt> both mean any amino acid except Ala and
        Met.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><tt>-</tt></td>
        <td>Allows each character to be separated from its neighbor by a dash
        (<tt>-</tt>).</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>*</td>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>&lt;</td>
        <td>Pattern must be in the N-terminal. The &lt; must be at the

<a id="Range"></a>
<h3>Selecting a Range</h3>

<p>Selecting a range of columns can be done quite easily directly in the
  Sequence Editor by using the columns headers and the <tt>Shift</tt>-click
  keystroke to extend a range. This, however, will select <i>all</i> the
  residues within the specified columns. Using the <b>Range</b> field in the
  Residue Selector, the residues can be restricted and the operation can be
  varied.</p>

<p>The range is used to specify multiple residues, not necessarily
  consecutive. Multiple values are entered separated by blanks or commas.
  Ranges are specified by separating two numbers with a hyphen (-). The range
  is expanded to include all integer values in-between the two numbers.</p>

<p>Three buttons are available to use on the specified range:</p>
  <table class="noborder">
      <tr>
        <td><b>Pos</b></td>
        <td>The residue position (column number) is determined by the SVL
        function <span class="svl">rPos</span>.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Index</b></td>
        <td>The residue index is determined by the SVL function <span class=
        "svl">rNumber</span>. This is the index of the residue in its parent
        chain.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>UID</b></td>
        <td>The residue UID is determined by the SVL function <span class=
        "svl">rUID</span> (an integer typically equal to the ID field in PDB
        files).</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

<h3>Selecting by Scalar</h3>

<p>Residues can be selected based on their scalar values. The sliders below
  the buttons allow a range to be specified.</p>
  <center>

<img src="select/scalar.png" alt="Scalar" class="center" />

<a id="Selecting_by_Atom_Data"></a>
<a id="Data"></a>
<h3>Selecting by Atom Data</h3>

<p>The <b>Atom Data</b> page has functions to select residues based on their
  internal atom data. For example, selecting by atom data can be used to
  discover residues that should be deleted prior to attempting a homology
  model.</p>
  <table class="noborder">
      <tr>
        <td>Missing Atoms</td>

<a id="Selecting_by_Amino_Acid_Functional_Class"></a>
<h3>Selecting by Amino Acid Functional Class</h3>

<p>Residues can be selected based on their amino acid functional classes. The
  following table gives the amino acids associated with each class:</p>
  <table class="noborder">

      </tr>
    </table>
<a id="Selecting_by_Structure"></a>
<a id="Structure"></a>
<h3>Selecting by Structure</h3>

<p>To select residues based on their underlying structure, use the
  <b>Secondary Structure</b> or <b>DSSP Label</b> pages. The SVL function
  <span class="svl">rActualSegment</span> is used to determine these
  residues.</p>
  <table class="noborder">
      <tr>
        <td>Helix:</td>
        <td>3-10-helix, 3-10-helix-left, helix, helix-left, pi-helix,
        pi-helix-left</td>

        'none'.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
<a id="Selecting_by_Ribbon_Mode"></a>
<a id="Ribbon"></a>
<h3>Selecting by Ribbon Mode</h3>

<p>The <b>Ribbon Style</b> page buttons identify residues whose ribbon mode
  is set to the specified token as determined by the SVL function <span class=
  "svl">rRibbonMode</span>. Whether or not the ribbon is currently drawn in the
  MOE Window does not affect these buttons.</p>
<a id="Selecting_by_Residue_Type"></a>
<a id="Type"></a>
<h3>Selecting by Residue Type</h3>

<p>There are four buttons available on the <b>Residue Type</b> page allowing
  the selection of specific kinds of residues. The residue types identified
  are: <b>Amino Acid</b> (as determined by the SVL function <span class=
  "svl">rType</span>), <b>Nucleic Acid</b> (as determined by the SVL function
  <span class="svl">rType</span>), <b>Salts &amp; Solvent</b> (waters and some
  simple ions, i.e. PO3, PO4, SO3, SO4), and <b>Ligand</b>. A ligand is defined
  as a residue that is not a solvent, not an amino acid and not a nucleic acid
  yet has more than one atom (i.e. none of the above types).</p>

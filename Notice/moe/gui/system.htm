<h1>Overview</h1>
</a>

<p>The System Manager provides information and control over the systems
  currently loaded in MOE. It is raised as a popup using <span class="menu">MOE
  | RHS | System</span> or <span class="menu">MOE | Popup | System</span>.
  Alternatively, it can be opened as a persistent window using <span class=
  "menu">MOE | Window | System Manager</span>, either attached to the right
  side of the MOE Window or as a separate detached window. From the popup, the
  System Manager can also be made persistent by pressing the <b>Attach</b> or
  <b>Detach</b> icons in the popup footer.<br />
  The attached System Manager can be detached using the <b>Detach</b> icon in
  the footer. The separate System Manager window can be attached using the
  <b>Attach</b> icon in the footer. The attached/detached state is remembered
  for the next time the System Manager is opened.</p>
<table class="noborder">
  <tr>
    <td><img src=
    "system/sys_attach.png" class="icon"/></td>
    <td>Attach System Manager to the right side
    of the MOE window.</td>
    <td><img src=
    "system/sys_detach.png" class="icon"/></td>
    <td>Detach System Manager from MOE
    window.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>After one or more clicks of items in the System Manager popup, moving the
  mouse outside the popup will cause it to be hidden. Press the <b>Esc</b> key
  or click outside the popup (e.g., with the middle mouse button) to hide the
  System Manager popup. The System Manager window stays open until closed with
  the <b>Close</b> button.</p>
  <div class="floatright"><img src="system/sys_popup2.png" alt=
  "System Popup" class="floatright" /></div>

<p>The System Manager provides quick access to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Visibility of atoms and surfaces.</li>
    <li>Active, inert, and selected state of atoms (independent of
    visibility).</li>
    <li>Coloring and rendering mode of atoms and ribbons.</li>
    <li>Creation of molecular and interaction quick surfaces.</li>
    <li>Render style, transparency, material, and coloring of surfaces.</li>
    <li>Names of chains and chain groupings (tags, groups, sets).</li>
  </ul>

<p>Additionally, the System Manager also allows one to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Browse visually ligand, solvent, and receptors.</li>
    <li>Reorder tag groups.</li>
    <li>Reorder ligand lines within tags.</li>
    <li>Merge tags and move Receptor/Ligand/Solvent lines between tags.</li>
    <li>Assign new chain tags and chain groups.</li>
    <li>Duplicate a ligand, receptor or tag.</li>
    <li>Find and mark lines with a string search.</li>
    <li>Find and mark ligands with a descriptor or SMILES search.</li>
    <li>Delete surfaces, grouped atoms, and sets.</li>
  </ul>

<p>The System Manager presents a multifunctional list of the molecular
  objects loaded in MOE. In MOE, molecular objects are arranged in a hierarchy:
  the <i>system</i> is a sequence of <i>chains</i>, each of which is a sequence
  of <i>residues</i>, each of which is a sequence of <i>atoms</i>. Generally
  speaking, the chains correspond to the chains of proteins and residues to the
  amino acids. Small molecules are generally confined to one residue (although
  not required). Multiple small molecules (ligand or solvent) are often
  collected into a single chain (to preserve PDB chain identifiers for
  example). Each chain has an associated chain <i>name</i> and chain
  <i>tag</i>. The tag is used to group chains (such as all chains from a
  specific PDB file). The name is used to hold the chain letter and other name
  information. An additional organizational grouping is the <i>group</i>, which
  collects chains of different tags. A <i>named set</i> may be used to
  represent an arbitrary collection of chains, residues, and atoms.</p>
  <div class="floatright"><img src="system/sys_popup3.png" alt=
  "System Manager lines" class="floatright" /></div>

<p>The System Manager is composed of a list of lines corresponding to groups
  (boldfaced, colored purple), sets (boldfaced, colored orange), chain tags
  (boldfaced) or collections of atoms (non-boldfaced) listed beneath the group,
  set, or tag lines; these lines can be hidden or shown in the list (collapsed
  or expanded). Group lines operate on all tag lines, chains, residues, and
  atoms in the group. Similarly, tag lines operate on all chains, residues and
  atoms in the tag. Non-tag lines operate on the corresponding collection of
  atoms (Receptor, Ligand, etc.). Set lines operate on all atoms in the set,
  although the controls behave differently in some cases as outlined below.
  Sequence-only and empty chains, if present, are represented by one single
  line below the set lines.
</p>

<a id="GroupControls">
<h2>Group and Tag Controls</h2>
</a>

<p>Within a tag group there are three different main classes of lines in the
  System Manager list: <b>Receptor</b>, <b>Solvent</b>, and <b>Ligand</b>. If
  the system has dummy atoms they are grouped in additional <b>Other</b> lines
  (one for each chain with dummy atoms). In the default list view mode there is
  only one <b>Receptor</b> and one <b>Solvent</b> line per tag group, even if
  the receptor and solvent molecules are spread over multiple chains. Distinct
  ligand chains on the other hand are listed as multiple <b>Ligand</b> lines.
  There is also an extended list view mode, in which multiple receptor and
  solvent chains in a tag group are split into separate <b>Receptor</b> and
  <b>Solvent</b> lines, and every ligand molecule is listed in its own
  <b>Ligand</b> line. To switch between the default basic and
  extended list view open the System Manager Settings panel from with the
  <img src="system/sys_config.png" class="icon"/> icon from the footer of the
  System Manager:
<table class="titlebar">
  <tr>
    <td><b>Basic View</b></td>
    <td>
    One <b>Receptor</b> and one <b>Solvent</b> line (if any) per tag group;
    each ligand chain in a separate <b>Ligand</b> line.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Extended View</b></td>
    <td>
    Each receptor/solvent chain in a separate <b>Receptor/Solvent</b> line;
    each ligand molecule in a separate <b>Ligand</b> line.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>If there is more than one tag group loaded in MOE, then an additional
  <b>System</b> header line is available which operates on all objects
  regardless of tag or group associations. The scope of the System header line
  can be reduced by pressing the double arrow <b>&lt; &gt;</b> in the System
  button of the System header line. Successive presses will cycle through
  different modes of operation in which the header line affects just
  <b>Receptor</b>, <b>Solvent</b>, <b>Ligand</b>, <b>Other</b>, or
  <b>Marked</b> lines, depending on what is present in the system.</p>

      the button shows an <tt><b>A</b></tt> on a green background;
      otherwise, the button shows an <tt><b>I</b></tt>. If all atoms are

      </ul>The partial inert state of tags and groups is remembered and
      preserved when tag/groups are hidden/shown with the named Show/Hide
      button (see below).

    <p>The active/inert control also indicates the fixed/tethered state of atoms
      represented in the line, if all atoms are fixed the control has a
      red border, if only some atoms are fixed the red border is dotted.

      The Show/Hide button containing a <b>Group</b> or <b>Tag</b> name, or
      <b>Receptor</b>, <b>Solvent</b>, <b>Ligand</b>, or <b>Other</b> chain
      name, controls the visibility <i>and</i> activity state of the atoms
      it represents. Group and tag lines affect all atoms in the group/tag
      while the other non-tag lines only affect the associated atoms. A
      colored (blue) background on the line indicates that at least one
      atom or ribbon segment is visible. A gray background on the line
      indicates that no atoms or ribbons are visible. Showing a line makes
      it active; hiding a line makes it inert (inactive). Keyboard
      modifiers affect the behavior:

      the group name can be set for all its associated tags and chains.
      In a tag line, the group and tag name are settable for all its
      descendant chains. Non-tag lines allow additionally to set the chain
      name (displayed on the named Show/Hide button for ligands, and
      displayed for other chains when the full expansion mode is turned on).

  automatically selected; the chain or tag name of the new atoms
  will be appended with <tt>(2)</tt> or a subsequent number.
  The original atoms of the duplicated System Manager line will be hidden

<a id="ConstrainObjects">

<p>The <b>System Manager | Popup</b> allows to constrain and unconstrain
  ligands, solvent, receptors and whole tags, groups or sets: Click the
  right mouse button over the System Manager line to constrain and
  choose <b>Fix</b> or <b>Tether</b> in the popup menu. This will
  then fix or tether all the atoms of the selected System Manager line.
  Conversely one can unfix and free the atoms with the options
  <b>Unfix</b> and <b>Free</b>. Fixed and tethered atoms will be indicated
  by a red or light red frame around the active/inert button in the
  object lines.

<a id="BrowseSystem">
<h1>Browse System</h1>
</a>

<p>With the System Manager, it is easy to analyze and compare complex
  systems. In docking experiments, one often has a single receptor structure
  loaded and desires to browse through a series of docked ligands, possibly
  also comparing each docked ligand to a reference ligand structure. With a
  <tt>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-</tt>click onto the named Show/Hide button of a ligand
  line only that ligand becomes visible and all others are hidden.</p>
  <div class="floatright"><img src="system/sys_footer.png" alt=
  "System Manager Footer" class="floatright" /></div>

<p>For large numbers of ligands, the footer of the System Manager has a next
  and previous arrow button to step through all the ligands loaded in MOE. The
  <b>RSL</b> button next to the arrow buttons opens a popup in which one can
  specify whether the arrow buttons step through the ligand, solvent, or
  receptor lines of the System Manager list. If <b>Receptor</b>,
  <b>Solvent</b>, and <b>Ligand</b> are all activated, the arrow buttons step
  through entire tag groups (equivalent to <tt>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-</tt>click on the
  tag lines). A <tt>&lt;Shift&gt;-</tt>click onto an arrow button jumps to the
  first or last list entry. Alternatively, one can use the <tt>Up</tt> and
  <tt>Down</tt> arrow keys on the keyboard to step through the system.</p>

<p>By default, the expansion state of the tags and groups is not changed
  during browsing. To automatically expand tags of browsed structures,
  <tt>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-</tt>click on the arrow buttons.</p>

<p>In order to keep one or more ligand lines visible during the ligand
  browsing, for reference comparisons, one has to make sure that the lines are
  visible but inactive before browsing. These lines will then not be included
  in the browsing and the associated structures will be kept visible. The same
  applies to receptor browsing.</p>

<a id="ReorderOrganizeSystem">
<h1>Reorder and Organize System</h1>
</a>

<p>It is possible to reorder the members of groups and tags in the System
  Manager with the mouse. In order to move an entire tag group, select the tag
  line with the mouse, and then press and hold the middle mouse button. A red
  rectangle appears around the tag line, indicating that it will be moved. To
  select the target of the move operation, continue to hold the middle mouse
  button and drag the mouse cursor to the list location where the tag should be
  moved to. While dragging, a red line will indicate the currently selected
  target. To move the tag, the destination must be between two tags. If the
  target is within a tag itself (receptor, solvent, ligand lines), then it is
  assumed that a merge of the source tag with the destination tag is requested.
  Once the middle mouse button is released, the move or merge is performed. In
  the case of a merge request, a confirmation panel will pop up.</p>

<p>Similarly, groups can be reordered and merged. To move an entire group,
  select the group line and drag it to the desired position. If the target
  location is within a group, a group merge action is possible, in which a
  confirmation dialog will open.</p>

<p>Receptor, solvent, or ligand lines can be moved between tags or groups
  using the middle mouse button in the same manner. Such a move and merge
  operation will also pop up a confirmation panel before the merge is
  performed.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Similarly to setting a new <b>Group</b>, new <b>Tag</b>, or
  new <b>Name</b>, moving a single non-tag line can cause new chains to be
  created in MOE: for example, if two ligands are in the same chain and one of
  the ligands is moved.</p>

<p>If a tag has multiple ligand lines (or multiple receptor/solvent lines in
  expanded-list mode) the ligand lines can be reordered within the group by
  dragging them with the middle mouse as described above. <b>Note:</b> The
  order of the classes within the tag (1. Receptor, 2. Solvent, 3. Ligand, 4.
  Other) cannot be changed, only the order of lines within its own class.</p>

<p>The System Manager also displays any named sets that exist in the system.
  The set name can be edited in the popup raised by pressing the lower right
  corner. The sets lines are always sorted alphabetically.</p>

<p>A <b>Group By</b> option is available in <b>System Manager | Popup</b>
  when auto grouping is available. Auto grouping can be set by adding
  delimiting group names using braces { } in chain headers.
  Structures loaded from project family databases have already
  chain headers for auto grouping set.</p>

<a id="SearchSystem">

</a>

  <div class="floatright"><img src="system/sys_searchline.png" alt=

<p>The leftmost button in the footer is the <b>Search</b> <img src=
  "system/sys_search.png" class="icon" alt="Search" /> button.
  It pops up a text search line. The entered text phrase will be searched
  within the chain names, groups, and tags of the System Manager list lines.
  Lines associated with matching structures are marked with blue text.
  Collapsed groups or tags with marked lines are automatically expanded.
  Repeated search for the same text string will show the next matching line
  with a temporary blue rectangle and scroll the list if needed to make the
  line visible.</p>

<p>Marked lines can be assigned to a group name by pressing the <b>Group</b>
  <img src="system/sys_group_button.png" class="icon" alt="Group"/>
  button. This opens a dialog box where a name for
  the group can be entered. After clicking <b>OK</b>, the grouped items will

<p>The search also accepts <a href=
  "../../quasar/fcnref/descrfcn.htm#DescriptorExprSyntax">QuaSAR descriptor
  expressions</a> and <a href="../fcnref/smartsfcn.htm">SMARTS</a> strings; but
  only searches for these in the ligand lines.</p>

<p>The marked state of lines can also be changed manually by pressing
  <tt>&lt;Alt&gt;-</tt>click on named Show/Hide button. A range of lines
  can be marked with <tt>&lt;Alt&gt;+&lt;Shift&gt;</tt>.
  <tt>&lt;Alt&gt;+&lt;Ctrl&gt;</tt> will mark the current line and unmark
  all others. Marked lines can be manipulated together by the system
  header line in <b>Marked</b> mode.</p>

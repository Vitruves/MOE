<h1>
<a id="OpenPanelFSB">Opening Files</a></h1>

<p>The MOE open file system is used to perform a variety of &quot;open&quot;
  operations on files of different formats. File formats are recognized
  automatically, but forcing a particular format interpretation is possible if
  necessary. Where additional options are available, a secondary panel will
  open. For example, when molecular data from a PDB file are being loaded into
  MOE, the <a href="../../proteins/pdb_mdb.htm#OpeningPDBFiles">Load PDB
  File</a> panel will be raised, or when an SKC file (sketch file) is opened,
  the <a href="mainwin.htm#SketchView">Sketch View</a> panel is raised.</p>

<p>In MOE, the notion of <i>opening</i> a file has been extended beyond such
  simple operations as opening a molecule file into the system or opening a
  database file into a database viewer. MOE's system for opening files
  allows you to browse files, to operate on multiple files, and to select from
  a variety of operations. For example, you can choose to either load a
  molecule into MOE or add it to a database file. The Open system is not
  limited to files containing molecular data. Opening an SVL file for example,
  allows you to load or run the SVL module.</p>

<p>To open a file, choose <span class="nobr"><b>File | Open</b></span> in
  either the MOE Window or the Sequence Editor, or use <span class="menu">MOE |
  RHS | Open</span>.</p>

<img src="fileopen/fileopen.png" alt=
  "Open Panel" class="center" />
<div class="floatright">
  <img src="fileopen/fileopen_filter.png" alt="File Filters"/>
  <p class="caption">Filters</p>
</div>

<p>The panel is made up of different pages, for opening files from folders,
  or from obtaining structure files from PSILO or the PDB. <a href=
  "../hellomoe.htm#File_Selection_Box">Navigation controls</a> are found at the
  top of the panel.</p>

<p>The first page of the Open panel presents a list of files from which you
  can select one or more to open, and a list of operations, common to all
  selected files, from which you can choose the operation to perform. For
  information on browsing files and directories, see the documentation on the
  <a href="../hellomoe.htm#File_Selection_Box">File Selection Box</a>.</p>

<p>Choose <b>All Files</b> to filter the list by file extensions of common
  types. In addition to the given file extensions, arbitrary file patterns can
  be entered in the filter text field.</p>

<p><span class="tip">Tip</span>&nbsp; File patterns are recognized only in
  the filter text field. File patterns will not be recognized if entered in the
  file text field. Items in the file text field must match an existing file to
  allow for any open operation to proceed.</p>

<p><br clear="both" /></p>

<p>To open files, select them in the list, or type their names into the file
  text field. If a single file is selected, its type will be shown in the
  <b>Open As</b> field, and the default action for that type will be shown in
  the <b>Action</b> field. If MOE does not correctly identify a file's
  type, you can enforce a file type by choosing from the <b>Open As</b> option
  list. Similarly, you can choose a non-default operation from the
  <b>Action</b> list.</p>

<img src="fileopen/fileopen_actions.png" alt="Action" class=
  "floatright" />

<p>If multiple files are selected, they will be shown in the text field as a
  comma-separated list. If all the selected files are the same type, that type
  will be shown in <b>Open As</b> option list, otherwise the type will be
  blank. The <b>Action</b> option list will initially show the default
  operation for the current type. If more than one type of file is selected,
  the <b>Action</b> option list will be populated with the operations (if any)
  common to all the selected files.</p>

<p>If the selected operation is <b>Open Molecule</b>, then the <b>Close
  System</b> checkbox will be available. If enabled, the current molecular
  system will be closed, and the new molecular data will be centered in the MOE
  Window.</p>

<p>To perform the currently chosen action on the selected files, press
  <b>OK</b> or <b>Apply</b>. Double-clicking in the list is the same as
  selecting a single file and pressing <b>OK</b>, in which case the default
  action associated with the selected file will be performed. Press <b>Edit</b>
  to load all the selected files into individual <a href="ted.htm">SVL Text
  Editors</a>. When either <b>Apply</b> or <b>Edit</b> is pressed, the panel
  remains open.</p>

<p><br clear="both" /></p>

<h2><a id="FileTypes">Available File Types</a></h2>

<p>The <b>Open As</b> field displays the detected file type of the selected
  file(s). If the file type is unrecognized, or if files of different types are
  selected, then the field is blank. The pulldown menu lists all file types
  currently recognized by MOE. Selecting from the menu forces the selected
  files to be treated as being of the specified type. The types currently
  recognized by the Open system are:</p>

<h1><a id="PSILODownload">Downloading PDB Files from PSILO</a></h1>

<p>The <span class="menu">PSILO</span> page of the Open panel is a direct link
between MOE and a
<a href="http://www.chemcomp.com/PSILO-Protein_Structure_Database_System.htm"
    target="_blank">PSILO server</a>.

<p class="center"><img src="fileopen/PSILO_browse.png" alt="PSILO Browse"/></p>

<p>When selected, the <span class="menu">PSILO</span> page immediately checks
for an index file in the
<a href="../../install/install.htm#RunEnv">DOWNLOADS</a> directory and uses its
contents when reporting search results in the Open panel.  This index file
will be created if necessary and automatically updated using web services.
</p>

<p class="blockquote">
<span class="tip">Note:</span> Downloading files from PSILO
may require configuring MOE to work with a proxy server. Depending on the
server, a dialog may pop up requesting a username and password for the proxy
server to continue. Please read instructions on
<a href="../../appendix/settings.htm#Proxy">Proxy&nbsp;Settings</a> if there are
problems opening structures.
</p>

<p>The version of PSILO being run on the PSILO server and the server's
URL are indicated in the titlebar of the Open panel.</p>

<a id="PSILOQuery"></a>
<h2>Querying PSILO</h2>

<img src="fileopen/psilo_query.png" alt="PSILO Query" class="floatright"/>

<p>
The PSILO query widget is found
at the top of the panel.  To perform a search:

<ol>
<li>Choose
which field or fields are to be searched (default is <b>All Text Fields</b>).
Depending on the field, different types of searches
(<span class="menu">keywords</span>, <span class="menu nobr">begins with</span>,
etc.) may be available.  The
data source for the query, e.g.
<span class="menu">MOE</span>, <span class="menu">Sketch</span> or
<span class="menu">Manual</span>, might also be specifiable.
<span class="tip">Note:</span> The list of possible search
fields is dynamically obtained from the PSILO server and may
vary depending on the server.
</li>
<li>Enter or choose a search term.  The exact format varies,
depending on the chosen search field. With some fields, such as <b>All Text
Fields</b> or <span class="menu nobr">GO Annotation</span>, after a few letters
have been typed, possible autocomplete options become available.
Press the
<img src="fileopen/down_arrow.png" alt="down arrow" class="icon" />
(textfield shortcut)
button to access these options. If the <i>Too many matches</i> message is
displayed, type a few more letters and try again.
Other fields, such as <span class="menu nobr">Space Group</span>, produce a
drop-down list of search terms from which to choose. Still others, such
as, <span class="menu nobr">Ligand | SMILES</span> search, allow choosing
<span class="menu">MOE</span> (to use selected atoms in the MOE Window as the
query) or <span class="menu">Sketch</span> (to define a query with a molecular
sketcher accessible through the
<img src="fileopen/sketch.png" alt="sketch" class="icon" />
button). Most fields support a <span class="menu">Manual</span> entry mode
which allows, for example, to enter a SMILES string
directly.
</li>
<li>Press the <span class="menu">Search</span>
button at top right to execute the search.
</li>
</ol>

<a id="PSILO3DQueries"></a>
<h3>3D Interaction Queries</h3>

<p>3D interaction queries can be specified from the MOE Window if the
query data
source is set to <span class="menu">MOE</span> from the drop-down, and the
<img src="fileopen/restraint.png" alt="restraints" class="icon" />
(restraint) button to build distance, angle
and/or dihedral restraints is pressed. The query is specified by
selecting all restrained atoms and any other relevant atoms.
Unselected atoms will be ignored.  Each
molecular fragment is defined to be either ligand or receptor, as
indicated in the MOE <a href="system.htm">System Manager</a>.  In general,
there should be one ligand and one receptor fragment in each
Interaction query.  Solvent atoms are considered
'ligand' for this purpose.  Atoms can be explicitly designated as
ligand atoms by selecting them and then choosing
<span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Ligand | Choose Ligand</span>.
Note that any query
fragment which contains a mixture of ligand and receptor atoms is considered
to be neither.</p>

<p>If an interaction search involves a ligand and a receptor fragment,
upon completion of the search, a button
<img src="fileopen/3d_environment.png" alt="3D environment button"
class="icon" /> will appear in the bottom right of the
panel to open an MDB file containing clustered ligands along with
their environment.
The ligands in each hit are first grouped by protomer, and then each protomer is
clustered with a very tight RMSD cutoff. This results in a number of clusters of
ligands with very similar conformations.  Each row of the MDB represents one
cluster and includes the superposed ligand fragments, as well as the interacting
receptor atoms.  This allows one to see if there are any patterns to the
distribution of receptor atoms in 3D space around the ligand, possibly dependent
on ligand conformation. When clustering the ligands, possible symmetries are
taken into account.</p>

<a id="PSILOOngoingSearch"></a>
<h3>Ongoing Search</h3>

<p>After launching a search, a progress bar replaces the query at the top
of the window.  While the search is ongoing, the
<span class="menu">Search</span> button is replaced by an
<img src="fileopen/cancel.png" alt="cancel" class="icon" />
button. Pressing this button will interrupt the current search.
A confirmation dialog will be displayed, and upon confirmation, the current
search is canceled and the panel will display the previous state.</p>

<a id="PSILOCompletedSearch"></a>
<h3>Completed Search</h3>

<p>When the search is complete, the number of hits returned is reported at the
bottom right, and the hitlist is displayed.
Hovering the mouse over any of the hitlist entries will
show a 2D depiction of the primary ligand for that structure, if
any. Select hits from the hitlist by clicking on them in the list. The total
number of selected hits is reported next to the total number of hits.  Buttons
below the hitlist give access to additional operations:</p>

<ul>
<li><img src="fileopen/favorite.png" alt="favorites" class="icon" /> Open
the Favorites prompter:

<img class="center" src="fileopen/favorite_prompter.png"
alt="favorite prompter"/>

Enter a unique name for the query, then press
<span class="menu">Save</span> to save the query as a favorite on the PSILO
server. Use the <img src="fileopen/clear.png" alt="clear" class="icon" />
button to clear the <span class="menu">Query Name</span> field, and
<img src="fileopen/cancel.png" alt="cancel" class="icon" /> to cancel without
saving.  A previously defined favorite can be retrieved from
the <span class="menu">Query | Favorite | Favorite Query</span> menu.
Press <span class="menu">Search</span> to perform a search with the favorite
query, or press
<img src="fileopen/cancel.png" alt="delete" class="icon" /> to permanently
delete the favorite from the PSILO server.
</li>

<li><img src="fileopen/subset.png" alt="subset" class="icon" /> Open
the Subset prompter.

<img src="fileopen/subset_prompter.png"
alt="subset prompter" class="center" />

The Subset prompter is available when there are selected entries in the
hitlist.  These selected entries can be saved under a name for later
access.  Enter a unique name for the subset, then press
<span class="menu">Save</span> to save the hitlist selection
to the PSILO server.
A previously defined subset can be retrieved from the
<span class="menu nobr">Query | Favorite | Subset</span> menu.
Press <span class="menu">Search</span> to retrieve the entries of
the selected subset, or press
<img src="fileopen/cancel.png" alt="delete" class="icon" /> to
permanently delete the subset from the PSILO server.
Note: Subsets not available for servers running a
2019 version of PSILO or earlier.
</li>

<li><span class="menu nobr">Browse in PSILO...</span> Launch PSILO
in a web browser.  The PSILO main search page will open with the current
search, if any, already loaded and with results displayed.</li>
</ul>

<a id="PSILODownloadDlg"></a>
<h3>Downloading Hits</h3>

<p>To open hits from a search hitlist into MOE,
select the desired hits in the hitlist and then press either
<b>Apply</b> or <b>OK</b>.  Both will open the
<span class="menu">PSILO Download</span> sub-panel
to download the selected hits in various formats.  After successfully downloading
the hits, OK will additionally close the Open panel; Apply will leave
the Open panel raised.</p>

<p>
The <span class="menu">PSILO Download</span> panel is used to transfer the
selected search results from the PSILO server into MOE.  Use
<span class="menu">Open as</span> to select how structures are transferred:</p>

<img src="fileopen/download_panel.png" alt="download panel" class="center" />

<ul>
<li><span class="menu">PDB</span>. Structures are downloaded as PDB files
and opened in
MOE.  Those with primary ligands defined also fetch a ligand CIF file,
which is used for dictionary correction to ensure the bond order and formal
charges match those defined in PSILO.  If
<span class="menu nobr">Load Electron Density Map</span> is on, the
electron density is computed for those records which have structure
factors in PSILO, and loaded as well.</li>

<li><span class="menu nobr">MOE MDB</span>. Structures are downloaded
into the MOE Database (MDB) specified in the panel, which will be
opened into a
<a href="../../mdb/db.htm">Database Viewer</a>.  The MDB will include
additional fields for each record, such as <tt>header</tt>, <tt>compnd</tt>,
<tt>source</tt>, as well as a separate field for the primary ligand, if any.
</li>

<li><span class="menu nobr">MOE MDB Biological Unit</span>.  Similar to
<span class="menu nobr">MOE MDB</span>, but here
the first Biological Unit is
created for each structure when building the database.</li>

<li><span class="menu">Ligands</span>. Open only the ligands from each
structure into MOE.
</li>

<li><span class="menu">Sequences</span>.  Open only the polymer sequences
into MOE; no atoms are created.
</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="menu">Superpose by</span> provides several options for how
structures will be superposed after opening into MOE, as follows.
<span class="tip">Note:</span> Superposition is not supported for
<span class="menu">MOE MDB Biological Unit</span> or
<span class="menu">Sequences</span>.</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="menu">None</span>. Coordinates are left as-is, with no
superposition performed.</li>

<li><span class="menu">Structure</span>. A standard sequence alignment followed
by superposition is performed.  This works well when all the sequences are
fairly similar.</li>

<li><span class="menu">Family</span>.  This option works best
when all the structures belong
to a single PSILO Family.  The precalculated matrices which superpose each
structure onto the Family Reference are used to superpose all structures into
the same frame of reference.  Any structures which do not belong to the largest
common Family will be left at their original coordinates.</li>

<li><span class="menu">Ligand</span>. Superposition is performed using a rigid
version of the <a href="../../apps/flex.htm">Flexible Alignment</a> algorithm on
the primary ligands only.  This is normally limited to a maximum of 5 structures
as performance can degrade appreciably above this limit.</li>

<li><span class="menu">Pocket</span>. Superpose based on the C&alpha; atoms of
the pocket in PSILO's pocket database for each structure.  Records which do not
superpose well onto the other pockets will be left at their original
coordinates. If the query was a pocket search using atoms in MOE, the
loaded structures will also be superposed onto the original query.</li>

<li><span class="menu">3D Query</span>.  This option is only available when an

<h1><a id="RCSBDownload">Downloading PDB Files from the RCSB</a></h1>

<p>The <b>RCSB</b> page of the Open panel is a direct link
  between MOE and the <a href="http://www.rcsb.org">RCSB Protein
  Data Bank</a> website.</p>

<img src="fileopen/RCSB_browse.png" class="center" />

<p>When selected, the <b>RCSB</b> page immediately checks
  for an index file in the <a href=
  "../../install/install.htm#RunEnv">DOWNLOADS</a> directory and uses its
  contents to initialize the Open panel file list. This index file will be
  created if necessary and automatically updated using web services. To
  download files, select their entries in the list or type their codes into the
  <b>Codes</b> text field, then press <b>OK</b> or <b>Apply</b>.
  Double-clicking in the list is the same as selecting a single
  entry and pressing <b>OK</b>.  The RCSB Chemical Component dictionary CIF
  files for ligands in each structure will be downloaded automatically when
  available, and used to correct bond orders and/or charges in the ligands.
  In doing so, the local 3D environment of the ligand is taken into account,
  so a different tautomer or charge state may result compared to that in
  the dictionary entry. Note that files can be downloaded even if the index file
  is not available, or if its code is not in the current index file. There is
  no need to wait for the index to finish updating before downloading files
  this way.</p>

  <img src="fileopen/fileopen_load.png" alt="Load" class=
  "floatright" />
<p>mmCIF files are downloaded by default, however this can be changed with
    the <b>Load</b> drop-down to PDB format if desired.  For structures not
    available in PDB format, mmCIF will be fetched regardless of this setting.
    If the <b>Electron Density Map</b> box is checked,
    the structure factors for the PDB file will be downloaded as well, and used
    to calculate the Electron Density maps.  These can then be toggled on and
    off using the <a href="../../apps/surfmap.htm">Surfaces and Maps</a>
    application.</p>

  <p class="blockquote">
    <span class="tip">Note:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Downloading files from the RCSB
    may require configuring MOE to work with a proxy server. Depending on the
    server, a dialog may pop up requesting a username and password for the proxy
    server to continue. Please read
    instructions on <a href=
    "../../appendix/settings.htm#Proxy">Proxy&nbsp;Settings</a> if there are
    problems using the download tool.
  </p>

<p>The index list displays the code, (accession) date, resolution (blank if
  NMR) and the entry name (title). The <b>Codes</b> and <b>Filter</b> fields
  can be used to search for specific database entries. The <b>Codes</b> field
  restricts the visible entries to those that match at least one code or
  pattern entered in the text field. The <b>Filter</b> field searches the index
  file for words, word fragments or quoted phrases. If <b>&quot;Or&quot; with
  Filter</b> is on, filter matches will be added to the list of visible
  entries; otherwise the <b>Filter</b> field will be used to further restrict
  which entries are displayed in the list.</p>

<p>The <b>Codes</b> and <b>Filter</b> text fields both admit the use of
  wildcards:</p>
  <table class="noborder">
    <tr>
      <td><tt>*</tt></td>
      <td>matches 0 or more of any character</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><tt>?</tt></td>
      <td>matches any single character</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><tt>@</tt></td>
      <td>matches any single character in [a..z, A..Z, _ ]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><tt>#</tt></td>
      <td>matches any single digit [0..9]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>matches any character in the set; ranges (using dash (<tt>-</tt>)
      symbol) are allowed</td>

    <tr>
      <td><tt>[^</tt>...<tt>]</tt></td>
      <td>matches any character <i>not</i> in the set</td>
    </tr>

<h1><a id="MOEPDB">Browsing the MOE Protein Database</a></h1>

<p>The <b>PDB</b> page is used to load molecules from MOE's <a href=
  "../../proteins/pdb_mdb.htm#MOEPDB">internal protein database</a>. Note that
  this database consists of individual protein domains however, not complete
  structures, so it may be of limited use for this purpose. Alternatively, the
  <b>PDB</b> page can be used to browse any molecular database file with a code
  (or chain name) field and a molecule field.</p>

<img src="fileopen/MOEPDB_browse.png" class="center" />

<p>When selected, the <b>PDB</b> page immediately loads index data from the
  specified MDB file (use <b>Browse</b> to select a different file). To load
  molecules into MOE, select their entries in the list and press <b>OK</b> or
  <b>Apply</b>. Double-clicking in the list is the same as selecting a single
  entry and pressing <b>OK</b>.</p>

<p>The index list displays the code, (accession) date, resolution (blank if
  NMR) and the entry name (title). The <b>Codes</b> and <b>Filter</b> fields
  can be used to search for specific database entries. The <b>Codes</b> field
  restricts the visible entries to those that match each at least one code or
  code pattern entered in the text field. The <b>Filter</b> field searches the
  index file for words, word fragments or quoted phrases. If <b>&quot;Or&quot;
  with Filter</b> is on, filter matches will be added to visible list;
  otherwise the visible list will be further restricted to entries matching
  both fields.</p>

<p>The <b>Codes</b> and <b>Filter</b> text fields both admit the use of
  wildcards:</p>
  <table class="noborder">
    <tr>
      <td><tt>*</tt></td>
      <td>matches 0 or more of any character</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><tt>?</tt></td>
      <td>matches any single character</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><tt>@</tt></td>
      <td>matches any single character in [a..z, A..Z, _ ]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><tt>#</tt></td>
      <td>matches any single digit [0..9]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><tt>[...]</tt></td>
      <td>matches any character in the set; ranges (using dash (<tt>-</tt>)
      symbol) are allowed</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

<p>The selected entries can be written to another MDB file by pressing
  <b>Copy</b>. The following panel will open:</p>

<img src="fileopen/CopyToDatabase.png" class="center" />

<p>If <b>Overwrite</b> is on, a new database will be created, otherwise the
  selected entries will be appended to the target file.</p>

<h1>
<a id="Purpose_and_Scope_of_this_Document">Purpose and Scope of this
  Manual</a></h1>

<p>This document has been written both as a user's guide and as a
  reference. Its purpose is to introduce the Scientific Vector Language (SVL)
  to new users, to act as a tutorial for intermediate-level users, and to serve
  as a reference for experienced SVL programmers.</p>

<p>This document is intended to give a comprehensive overview of the basic
  SVL package. The basic SVL package may be run on its own, but it is very
  likely that you will be executing SVL commands from within
  application-specific software in which SVL has been embedded. In this case,
  the application-specific software may have a library of user-callable SVL
  routines. These routines are beyond the scope of this manual, and for more
  information on them, please refer to their accompanying documentation.</p>

<p>A good grasp of vector concepts and a good SVL programming style can be
  achieved only through coding experience. Our aim has been to give users a
  sufficient understanding of the principles of vector programming and of SVL
  to be able to write their own code.</p>

<p>Although vector programming is a natural, efficient means for treating
  data, most people are familiar only with the scalar programming approach. We
  expect that many users embarking on this manual will have had little or no
  prior experience with vector languages, so we will begin with a proper
  introduction to vector concepts. It is our hope that users will come to see
  the vector as a natural unit for data manipulation.</p>

<p>In examples, <tt>typewriter</tt> style is used to indicate SVL input and
  output. The SVL prompt <tt>svl&gt;</tt> signals that what immediately follows
  is what the user should type at the keyboard at the SVL command line. Do not
  type the letters <tt>svl&gt;</tt> as part of the command. The result, as
  returned by SVL in interactive mode, is displayed in <tt>typewriter</tt> font
  without a prompt. When you are starting out, be sure to type exactly what is
  given; in particular, be scrupulous about reproducing brackets and uppercase
  letters.</p>

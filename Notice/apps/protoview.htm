<p>The <b>Protomers</b> panel is an interactive means for viewing protonation
  states of small molecules, possibly in a 3D context. When the panel opens, a
  reference molecule is obtained from the contents of the MOE Window, and its
  tautomers/protomers are enumerated and displayed in the panel. To open the
  panel, use <nobr><b>MOE | Compute | Prepare | Protomers.</b></nobr>.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> If multiple ligands are <a href="ligx.htm#System">active</a>
  or if the ligand exceeds 100 heavy atoms, the Protomers panel will be empty
  when it opens. If more than one ligand is active, either activate only one
  (using <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | <a href=
  "ligx.htm#System">System</a></span>) and then select <b>Apply</b> or choose a
  different set of source atoms. If the ligand comprises more than 100 heavy
  atoms, you can select <b>Apply</b> in the <b>Protomers</b> panel and select
  Yes when asked to continue to allow for larger ligands.</p>

<p>Note: The <a href="../moe/molsystems/build.htm">Builder</a> can also be
  used to view and change the tautomeric state of a molecule.</p>

<img src="protoview/protomers_panel.png" class="center" />

<p>The tautomer and protomer enumeration algorithm is implemented by the
  function <tt>ctab_ProtomerList</tt>, documented in the <a href=
  "../mdb/wash.htm">Database Wash</a> manual, and also used by the
  <tt>sdwash</tt> command line tool. Tautomers of a molecule are formed by
  migration of hydrogen atoms and bond orders to form isomeric species, while
  protomers are formed by addition or removal of acidic protons.</p>

<p>The panel consists of several parts:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Enumeration controls (top), which specify the source of the reference
    structure, and how to generate and rank the tautomers/protomers</li>
    <li>The tautomers and protomers (middle), which take up most of the
    panel</li>
    <li>Display options and navigation controls (bottom)</li>
  </ul>

<p>The panel controls are described as follows:</p>
  <table class="noborder">
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><b>Source</b></td>
      <td>
        The atoms used to compose the reference molecule may be selected. The
        default value, <b>Ligand&nbsp;Atoms</b>, excludes atoms which are
        classified as receptor or solvent. Other options include: Selected
        Atoms, Selected Residues, Selected Chains and Ligand tags. All options
        in the source menu except <b>Ligand Atoms</b> ignore the <a href=
        "ligx.htm#System">active state</a> of the molecule.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><b>3D Receptor</b></td>
      <td>
        By default, the classification of tautomers is &quot;2D&quot;, which
        means that the labeled chemical graphs are the only distinguishing
        features of the enumerated protomers. The enumerated list is ranked
        predicted concentration (e.g. ketones tend to be favored over enols,
        aromatic rings are preferred, etc.). Redundant chemical graphs are
        removed, i.e. if two molecular species have the same canonical SMILES
        identifier, only one is retained.

<p>If <b>3D Receptor</b> is enabled, then the original coordinates are
        included in the calculation of the rank ordering of the enumerated
        species &ndash; the actual bond distances are compared to the expected
        bond distances for single, double or aromatic bonds, and the planarity
        of <i>sp<sup>2</sup></i> and <i>sp<sup>3</sup></i> centers is taken
        into account.</p>

<p>By default <b>Receptor</b> the value is <tt>None</tt>, which
        produces no additional effect. If it is changed to non-blank value,
        such as <tt>Receptor Atoms</tt>, the effects of a receptor such as the
        host protein are taken into account when rank-ordering the enumerated
        species. Protomers which are well placed to participate in a
        significant hydrogen bonding interaction with the receptor are
        prioritized and appear near the beginning of the list.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><b>Tautomers Protomers</b></td>
      <td>
        The enumerated species are displayed in the main part of the panel as
        a matrix of buttons. The button which corresponds to the reference
        molecule from which the protomers were enumerated is labelled with
        an asterisk (<b>*</b>) in the lower right corner. The current
        protonation state of molecule in the MOE window is drawn with a
        highlighted background. The molecules are drawn in the buttons so that
        the heavy atoms are depicted in the same way in each case, but the bond
        orders and hydrogen counts differ. The atoms which are involved in any
        kind of change anywhere in the series are drawn in blue, while those
        which are not affected by any changes are drawn in black.

       <p>Clicking on any of the buttons will offer to copy the modified
        protomer to the MOE Window. When possible, this will use the original
        atoms, and only modify the charge and bond order of the heavy atoms,
        and adjust the explicit hydrogen atoms accordingly.
        The button background highlight will be changed to the now
        current protonation state.

      selecting one of the dimensions, which include 2x1, 4x2, 6x3 and 8x4. For
      the more densely packed page sizes, it may be necessary to adjust the
      size of the panel in order to see the molecules.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><b>Auto</b></td>
      <td>If on, Page Size will automatically be adjusted to best fit the
      total number of tautomers or protomers.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><b>Navigation</b></td>
      <td>If there are more protomers than will fit on a single page, then the
      navigation buttons become available for skipping through pages. Arrows
      for first, previous, next and last will be active when they apply.
      Alternatively, a page number may be entered in the text box, and pressing
      <tt>ENTER</tt> will jump to that page. The total number of tautomers or
      protomers is displayed to the right.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

<p>For the enumeration controls (source, mode, receptor), it is necessary to
  press the <b>Apply</b> button in order to apply the changes. The enumeration
  process is typically instantaneous for molecules with only several tautomers
  or protomers, but since the number of distinct structures grows exponentially
  with the number of tautomer/protomer sites, the calculation can take several
  seconds for more complicated reference molecules.</p>

<h1>Electron Density Surface</h1>

<p>An electron density surface is a representation of the electron-density
  distribution in a unit cell, sampled over a grid. To visualize the electron
  density surface, either isosurfaces or cutplanes can be used. MOE calculates
  the electron density surface from reflection data stored in the MTZ (CCP4)
  file format. Both structure factor amplitude and phase data must be present
  in the file.</p>

<p>Electron density is calculated from the expression:
  <!-- <span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
\rho \left( x,y,z \right) =
    \frac{1}{V} \sum_{h} \sum_{k} \sum_{l}
        F\left( h,k,l \right) \textrm{e}^{-2 \pi \textrm{i} \left( hx + ky + lz \right)}
\end{align}
</span> --></p>

<img src="edsurf/math_edsurf_eq0.png" class="center" />

<p>where</p>
  <table class="noborder">
    <tr>
      <td>&rho;</td>
      <td>electron density</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><em>x,y,z</em></td>
      <td>the <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, <em>z</em> fractional coordinates in the
      unit cell</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><em>F</em></td>
      <td>structure factor, having magnitude and phase</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><em>h,k,l</em></td>
      <td>the <em>h</em>, <em>k</em>, <em>l</em> indices of reflection</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><em>V</em></td>
      <td>volume of the unit cell</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

<p>From this expression, it is seen that the electron density is the inverse
  Fourier transform of the structure factor. In MOE, Fast Fourier Transform
  (FFT) techniques are used to perform the calculation.

<h1>Creating an Electron Density Surface</h1>

<p>To open the Electron Density Surface panel, use <b><nobr>MOE | File |
  Open</nobr></b> to open an MTZ file. The following panel appears:</p>

<img src="edsurf/panel.png" alt="Electron Density Surface Panel" class="center" />

<p>You can also invoke the panel by entering</p>

<pre>
    run 'edsurf.svl'
</pre>

<p>which will prompt you for the name of the MTZ file to read.</p>

<p>At the top of the panel, the name of the source file containing the
  reflection data is displayed in the <b>File</b> text field. The <b>Map</b>
  pulldown menu allows you to select from the maps that have been calculated,
  if any. Map names are constructed from the parameters used in the map
  calculations. For example, <tt>F,PHIC</tt> would be the name of a map
  computed using the columns <tt>F</tt> and <tt>PHIC</tt>. These map names are
  used to prefix the graphic objects (isosurface, cutplanes, unit cell box,
  etc.) that are created for visualizing the density field, and appear in the
  <a href="../moe/gui/gobjman.htm">Graphics Object Manager</a>, which can be
  used to hide or delete the surfaces, or to change their material and
  transparency properties. Maps can be deleted using the <b>Delete</b> button
  next to the <b>Map</b> pulldown menu. Deleting a map will delete all
  associated graphic objects (isosurface, cutplanes, etc.).</p>

<p>The remainder of the panel is occupied by a pager. The <b>File
  Information</b> page contains crystallographic information gleaned from the
  source file, as well as information about the electron density surface. Here,
  you can specify which columns to use, and whether a difference map is to be
  calculated.</p>

<p>The <b>Isosurface</b> and <b>Cutplanes</b> pages are dedicated to controls
  for rendering the surface using either an isosurface or cutplanes,
  respectively.</p>

<p>Before an electron density surface can be rendered, it must be calculated.
  Select the columns to be used and press <b>Calculate Map</b> to do the
  calculation. The <b>Map</b> pulldown menu will be updated to reflect the
  newly computed map. Several maps can be held in memory concurrently, and you
  can switch between them simply by making a selection in this menu. Once the
  calculation is complete, use the <b>Isosurface</b> and <b>Cutplanes</b> pages
  to generate graphical renderings of the map. Subsequent changes made to the
  isosurface and cutplane parameters do not require recalculation of the
  electron density map. Most changes are made automatically. Pressing
  <b>Apply</b> will ensure any changes are put into effect.</p>

<p>The electron density surface calculation may take a few moments to
  complete. Progress information is displayed in both the MOE Window and the
  SVL Commands window.

<h2>Crystallographic and Surface Information</h2>

<p>The <b>File Info</b> page displays space group and unit cell information,
  as well as the size and range of values of the calculated electron density
  surface. The size and minimum and maximum values of the map (<b>Grid
  Size</b>, <b>Min</b>, and <b>Max</b>) are displayed only after the electron
  density surface has been calculated, i.e. after <b>Calculate Map</b> has been
  pressed.</p>

<p>Difference map calculation is achieved by turning on <b>Difference Map</b>
  and selecting the kind of map to compute, as well as a second F column, then
  pressing <b>Calculate Map</b>.</p>

<img src="edsurf/fileinfo.png" alt="File Information Page" class="center" />

<p>The data columns to be used as the structure factor magnitude and phase
  data in the electron density calculation are specified using the following
  options:</p>
  <table class="noborder">
    <tr>
      <td><b>F</b></td>
      <td>Name of the MTZ file data column in which the structure
      factor amplitude data is stored. Only columns of type 'F' are
      listed here.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>phi</b></td>
      <td>Name of the MTZ file data column in which the calculated
      structure factor phase data is stored. Only columns of type 'P'
      are listed here.</td>

    <tr>
      <td><b>Use&nbsp;A&nbsp;and&nbsp;B</b></td>
      <td>In some files, the real and imaginary parts (<i>A</i>
      and <i>B</i>) of the structure factor are present as data columns. In
      this case, turning on <b>Use A and B</b> will allow these fields to be
      specified and used instead of magnitude and phase data.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>A</b></td>
      <td>Name of the MTZ file data column in which the real part
      of the structure is stored. Only columns of type 'R' are listed

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>F2</b></td>
      <td>The second F column to be used in computing a difference

      <b>F</b>, both weighted according to the type of map chosen, and the
      result used as the magnitude data for calculating the map.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

<p>When any of the magnitude (<b>|F|</b>) and phase (<b>phi</b>), <b>A</b>
  and <b>B</b> fields, or difference map parameters are changed, the electron
  density map must be recalculated. Press <b>Calculate Map</b> to do so.</p>

<h2>Specifying an Electron Density Isosurface</h2>

<p>When rendering an electron density surface using an isosurface, the
  extent, contour level, color, and rendering mode can all be specified.</p>

<img src="edsurf/iso_panel.png" alt="Isosurface Page" class="center" />

<p>The electron density isosurface can be drawn throughout a single unit cell
  or can be restricted to a box and/or to a subset of atoms of the asymmetric
  unit and its crystallographic symmetry images within the unit cell or its
  immediate neighboring cells.</p>

<p>The restricting atoms are specified by turning on the <b>Near</b>
  checkbox. You can choose from any of the currently recognized named atom
  collections in the system, e.g. Ligand, Receptor, All Atoms, Selected Atoms,
  etc.</p>

<p>In all cases, the following can be set:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Within</b>. The value here defines the <i>proximity to the
    restricting set of atoms</i>. The surface is rendered only within the
    specified distance of the set of restricting atoms.</li>
    <li><b>Visible</b>. If on, only visible atoms of the restricting set will
    be used.</li>
  </ul>

<p>The isosurface can be further restricted to a box by turning on
  <b>Restrict to Box</b>. The box position and size can be controlled using the
  <b>Position</b> trackball (translation only) and <b>Box Size</b> sliders, and
  its display can be turned on and off using the <b>Show Restricting Box</b>
  toggle. Box size is specified as fractions of the unit cell. The trackball
  operates as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Translation in X-Y</b>. <tt>&lt;Shift&gt;</tt>-left drag. The
    movement will be in viewing coordinates (i.e. moving the mouse right will
    result in movement to the right).</li>
    <li><b>Translation in Z</b>. <tt>&lt;Ctrl&gt;</tt>-left drag. The movement
    will be in viewing coordinates, moving the box towards or away from the
    viewer.</li>
  </ul>

<p>Choosing a lower density for rendering the isosurface when using the
  restricting box will result in smoother, more responsive motion of the
  restricted isosurface.</p>

    "Isosurface Restricted to Nearby Atoms" /><br />
    <i>Isosurface restricted to atoms of selected residues.<br />
    Coloring is by atom element.</i>
  </center>

<p>The controls to change the rendering style of the isosurface are:</p>
  <table class="noborder">
    <tr>
      <td><b>Render</b></td>
      <td>The isosurface can be rendered in one of three modes: as
      a dot surface (<b>Dot</b>), a mesh surface (<b>Line</b>), or a shaded
      surface (<b>Solid</b>). Selecting <b>None</b> will prevent the isosurface
      from being calculated. This is useful for saving time when the isosurface
      is not needed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Level</b></td>
      <td>The contour level of the isosurface is specified using
      the <b>Level</b> slider. The level is given in units of sigma (standard
      deviation of the density). The slider value can alternatively be
      controlled by entering a value in the text field and pressing
      <tt>Enter</tt>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Color</b></td>
      <td>
        The colors used for coloring the surface can be set using one of the
        following schemes:
        <table class="noborder">
          <tr>
            <td><b>Grid</b></td>
            <td>Color taken from the map colormap, where low values are mapped
            to blue, high to red.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><b>Gradient</b></td>
            <td>Gradient of the electron density distribution.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><b>Atom</b></td>
            <td>Color by the atom color of the nearest atom; dark gray if no
            atoms nearby.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><b>Residue</b></td>
            <td>Color by the residue color of the nearest atom's residue;

    </tr>
  </table>
<a id="SpecifyingCutplane"></a>
<h2>Specifying an Electron Density Cutplane</h2>

<p>An electron density surface can be visualized using cutplanes. A cutplane
  is created by pressing <b>New</b>. To switch between existing cutplanes, use
  the pulldown menu. All cutplanes can be rendered simultaneously. Cutplanes
  can also be deleted.</p>
  <img src="edsurf/cut_panel.png" alt="Cutplane Page" class="center" />

<p>When a cutplane is first created, it is oriented perpendicular to the
  <i>a</i>-axis of the unit cell. Subsequently, the cutplane can be translated
  and rotated. It can also be &quot;snapped&quot;, by pressing one of the
  <b>Snap</b> buttons, to one of the major axes of the unit cell, or to the
  current set of selected (<b>sel</b>), visible (<b>vis</b>), or restricting
  (<b>near</b>) atoms. The center of rotation and normal to the plane are
  indicated by a small green ball and a green arrow, respectively, whose
  display can be turned on and off using the <b>Show Cutplane Center and
  Normal</b> toggle.</p>

<p>The rendering parameters for each cutplane are set independently:</p>
<table class="noborder">
  <tr>
    <td><b>Render</b></td>
    <td>Each cutplane can be rendered independently of the
    others as either dots, lines, or a solid sheet. To turn off the rendering
    of the chosen cutplane, select <b>None</b>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>T</b></td>
    <td>
      5 levels of cutplane transparency are provided. <b>0</b> gives an
      opaque surface (fastest drawing mode). Transparency can also be
      controlled from the <a href="../moe/gui/gobjman.htm">Graphics Object
      Manager</a>, which also has controls for setting material properties.
      The <b>Color Scale</b> can also be used to set cutplane transparency.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Density</b></td>
    <td>Specifies the relative density of the cutplane sample
    points with respect to the average density of the grid points. The
    cutplane can be rendered more coarsely by choosing a lower rendering
    resolution.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Color Scale</b></td>
    <td>
      Cutplane colormap. The three colors are used to color to low, medium,
      and high density areas, respectively. The density values are specified
      in units of sigma (standard deviation of the density). Density values
      equal to or lower than the lower bound are colored by the corresponding
      color (default blue). Similarly, values equal to or higher than the
      upper bound are colored by the corresponding color (default red). For
      intermediate density values, color interpolation is performed.

<p>Each color has a separate transparency channel, accessible through
      the pulldown area of the color widget. A transparency value of 0 or
      less produces an opaque surface. Higher values provide more
      transparency. This can be useful, for instance, for making areas of low
      density transparent, while leaving the high-density areas opaque.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Position</b></td>
    <td>
      The position of the center of the cutplane. The trackball operates as
      follows:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Rotation</b>. Left drag.</li>
        <li><b>Translation in X-Y</b>. <tt>&lt;Shift&gt;</tt>-left drag. The
        movement will be in viewing coordinates (i.e. moving the mouse right
        will result in movement to the right).</li>
        <li><b>Translation in Z</b>. <tt>&lt;Ctrl&gt;</tt>-left drag. The
        movement will be in viewing coordinates, moving the box towards or
        away from the viewer.</li>
      </ul>

<p>The wheel is used to translate the plane in the direction of its
      normal.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Like isosurfaces, cutplanes can be restricted to named atom sets. Turn on
  <b>Near</b> to access the list of currently available restricting atom sets.
  The <b>Within</b> field dictates how large a patch is drawn around the atoms.
  When <b>Visible</b> is on, only visible atoms of the restricting set are
  used.</p>

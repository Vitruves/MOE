<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p><a href=
"https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/solutions/csd-system/components/"
  target="_blank">Mogul</a> from the <a href="http://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/"
  target="_blank">Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre</a> provides precise
  information on preferred molecular geometries using millions of chemically
  classified bond lengths, angles and acyclic torsion angles derived from the
  Cambridge Structural Database. Mogul includes a graphical user interface that
  allows users to load and analyze individual structures:</p>

<img src="mogul/biotinmogul.png" alt=
  "Biotin in Mogul" class="center" />

<p>The results are presented as a histogram, and full descriptive statistics
  are included. Users can also review the individual fragments drawn from the
  Mogul database (containing the specific geometric parameter) used to
  construct the histogram.</p>

<p>Mogul can also be run in the background via instruction files written in a
  simple text-based command language. This allows Mogul to be integrated into
  MOE in several ways: (a) Mogul Analysis, an application allowing users to
  interactively review, modify and monitor all or part of their structure
  (described below), (b) the <a href=
  "../moe/gui/mainwin.htm#DihedralProfile">Dihedral Profile</a> display has
  been modified to show the Mogul histogram data if available and (c) using
  <a href="../install/web_inst.htm">MOE/web</a> to provide easy
  access to a remote Mogul server.
  <!-- ============================ RUNNING ================================ !--></p>
<a id="Panel"></a>
<h1>Running Mogul Analysis</h1>

<p>To use the Mogul Analysis application, load a structure into the main MOE
  window and select <span class="menu">MOE | Compute | Conformations | Mogul
  Analysis</span> to start the application:</p>

<img src="mogul/mogulpanel.png" alt=
  "Mogul Analysis Panel" class="center" />

<p>This panel is divided into two parts: the top contains information on the
  composition, value and quality metric for each of the desired geometric
  features. The bottom displays a histogram of the structural information
  provided by Mogul. This display is dynamic, reflecting the current values of
  the geometric features and is cleared when the topological changes are
  made.</p>
  <table class="noborder">
    <tr>
      <td><b>Info</b></td>
      <td>Indicates whether the value of the geometric feature is sufficiently
      different from the tabulated data (unusual) or whether there is limited
      or no information about the feature in Mogul's database
      (insufficient). Unusual features are indicated by a <b>u</b> and features
      with insufficient information are indicated by an <b>i</b>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Atom1&nbsp;-<br />
      Atom4</b></td>
      <td>The atoms making up the specific geometric feature: <span class=
      "nobr"><tt>Atom1-Atom2</tt></span> for a bond length, etc. If the atoms
      have a name, it is provided in parentheses.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Value</b></td>
      <td>The value of the specific geometric feature, angstroms for bond
      lengths and degrees for bond angles and torsions.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Metric</b></td>
      <td>The value of the quality metric used by Mogul to determine whether
      the specific geometric feature is unusual. For bond length and angles the
      Z-Score is used while for torsions the local density, defined as the
      percentage of observed values within 10&deg;, is used.</td>

      enter a new value and press return. Bond angles are restricted to
      [0,&nbsp;180] degrees and torsions to [-180,&nbsp;180] degrees. Changing
      the value might change other geometric features related by shared
      atoms.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Reverse</b></td>
      <td>By default, changing the Current Value moves the rightmost atom
      (<tt>Atom2</tt> of <span class="nobr"><tt>Atom1-Atom2</tt></span>, etc).
      Pressing <b>Reverse</b> causes the leftmost atom (<tt>Atom1</tt> of
      <span class="nobr"><tt>Atom1-Atom2</tt></span>) to move instead. The
      first atom of the moving side, <tt>Atom1</tt>, will be rendered with a
      starry halo. The button turns <font color="red">red</font> as a reminder.
      Press the <b>?</b> button to the right to briefly highlight (in the MOE
      window) the moving atom.</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Analyze</b></td>
<td>Specify which geometric features are included in the Mogul calculation.
Select <span class="nobr"><b>Bond Lengths</b></span>,
<span class="nobr"><b>Bond Angles</b></span>, or
<span class="nobr"><b>Torsion Angles</b></span> to include that feature class.
</td>
</tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Settings</b></td>
      <td>The Mogul Analysis Settings panel can be used to specify how to find
      the Mogul executable and whether Mogul should ignore geometric
      information from organometallic or solvent molecules. The panel is
      described <a href="#Settings">below</a>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Histogram Plot</b></td>
      <td>The plot shows a histogram of the structural information provided by
      Mogul for the currently-selected geometric feature. The X-axis is the

      the histogram, <font color="red">red</font> if unusual and <font color=
      "green">green</font> otherwise. This value can be changed by picking in
      the plot or changing the Current Value field. The setting of the Reverse
      button specifies which end of the molecule will move. Changing the value
      might change other geometric features related by shared atoms.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Run</b></td>
      <td>Select two or more adjacent heavy atoms and press <b>Run</b> to
      analyze the current structure using Mogul.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Reset</b></td>
      <td>Pressing <b>Reset</b> restores the geometry and selection state of
      the current structures to that of the last Mogul calculation (when Run
      was pressed).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Open in Mogul</b></td>
      <td>This button is active if a local copy of Mogul is available. Pressing
      <span class="nobr"><b>Open in Mogul</b></span> opens Mogul to display the
      current structure and the currently selected geometric feature. This can
      be used for detailed investigation of individual parameters using the
      structural information found by Mogul.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

<p>After selecting the appropriate atoms, press <b>Run</b> to start the Mogul
  analysis. A message appears in the main MOE window while Mogul is running.
  Upon completion, the structural information is read and the Mogul Analysis
  panel is updated:</p>

<img src="mogul/mogulpanel2.png" alt=
  "Updated Mogul Analysis Panel" class="center" />

<p>In this case, the <tt>C(1)-C(2)</tt> bond length is unusual (marked with a
  <b>u</b>), with a Metric (Z-score) greater than 2.0. Picking a geometric
  feature loads the histogram plot with the data from Mogul. If the feature is
  not in a ring, the first atom of the moving side will be rendered with a
  starry halo. This is demonstrated <a href="#Analyze">below</a>.

  <!-- ============================ CONFIG PANEL =========================== !--></p>

      search.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Exclude Solvent</b></td>
      <td>If this checkbox is selected, Mogul will ignore any fragments in the
      Mogul database that come from structures in the CCDC catalog of known

</tr>
  </table>

<p>All changes are also recorded in the MOE configuration file and take
  effect the next time Mogul Analysis is used.

<h1>Examples</h1>

<p>In this section, we will present a number of example calculations using
  Mogul. The input file, used in both examples, is available in <span class=
  "nobr"><tt>$MOE/sample/mol</tt></span>.
<a id="Analyze"></a>
</p>

<h2>Analyze a Structure</h2>
  <div class="example">
    <ol start="1">
      <li>Clear the system:

<p class="indent_novspace"><span class="menu">MOE | File |
        Close</span></p><br />
      </li>
      <li>Load a structure into MOE:

<p class="indent_novspace"><span class="menu">RHS | Open</span></p>In
        the Open panel, select <span class=

        <br />
      </li>
      <li>Start <b>Mogul Analysis</b>:

<p class="indent_novspace"><span class="menu">MOE | Compute |

      <li>
        <i>Select a portion of the molecule</i><br />
        Orient the molecules as shown below.<br />
        Select the atoms of the tail.<br />

<img src="mogul/biotinpix.png" alt=
        "Biotin Selected Subset" class="center" />
      </li>
    </ol>Press <b>Run</b> to analyze the selected subset with Mogul. A message
    appears in the MOE window while Mogul is running. When completed, the Mogul
    Analysis panel will be updated:

<img src="mogul/biotinresults1.png" alt=
    "Biotin Subset Results 1" class="center" />The panel contains the Mogul information
    for all geometric features contained in the selected subset: 4 torsions, 6
    bonds and 6 angles. Selecting the first torsion <span class=
    "nobr"><tt>C(C9)-C(C10)-C(C11)-O(O11)</tt></span> displays the histogram
    from Mogul:

<img src="mogul/biotinresults2.png" alt=
    "Biotin Subset Results 2" class="center" />The atom selection in the MOE window has
    been changed to reflect the specific torsion. The Current Value is shown as
    a red line in the histogram. If a local installation of Mogul is available,
    <span class="nobr"><b>Open in Mogul</b></span> can be pressed to bring up
    the specific torsion in the Mogul GUI:

<img src="mogul/biotinmogul.png" alt=
    "Biotin in Mogul" class="center" />This allows the user to explore the fragments and
    other information used by Mogul to create the histogram.

<p>As mentioned previously, the histogram in in the Mogul Analysis panel is
    dynamic; changes to the geometry of the system are reflected by changes to
    the appropriate geometric parameters. The value of the currently selected
    torsion angle can be changed by entering a different value in the Current
    Value field and hitting return or by picking elsewhere on the histogram
    plot.</p>

<p>For example, the value of this dihedral can be changed by picking on the
    histogram in the low-valued histogram bar at roughly -155 degrees. The line
    on the histogram and the Current Value are changed to reflect the new value
    and the geometry of the carboxylate group is adjusted. The line becomes
    green because there is sufficient information in the adjacent bins:</p>

<img src="mogul/adjust1.png" alt=
    "Adjusted Biotin Results 1" class="center" />Note that the value for <span class=
    "nobr"><tt>C(C9)-C(C10)-C(C11)-O(O12)</tt></span>, which shares the same
    rotatable bond, has changed to roughly 25&deg;. By default, changing the
    dihedral moves the oxygen atoms (Atom4). If Reverse is pressed, the ring
    and unselected chain atoms will move. <tt>Atom1</tt> will be rendered with
    a starry halo to indicate the root of the moving portion. Picking on the
    histogram will keep the position of the carboxylate group constant and move
    the rest of the structures. Alternatively, pressing <span class="menu">RHS
    | Minimize</span> will relax the current structure, simultaneously changing
    all of the parameters as the calculation progresses. If a strained geometry
    results, some of the geometric parameters might be marked unusual.

<a id="Dihedral"></a>
<h2>Annotated Dihedral Profile</h2>
  <div class="example">
    <ol start="1">
      <li>
        <div class="floatright"><img src="mogul/biotinbond1b.png" alt=
        "Biotin Dihedral 1" class="floatright" /></div>Clear the system:

<p class="indent_novspace"><span class="menu">MOE | File |
        Close</span></p><br />
      </li>
      <li>Load a structure into MOE:

<p class="indent_novspace"><span class="menu">RHS | Open</span></p>In
        the Open panel, select <span class=
        "nobr"><tt>$MOE/sample/mol/biotin.moe</tt></span>.<br />
        <br />
      </li>
      <li><i>Pick the desired bond</i><br />
      Orient biotin to expose the side chain<br />
      Pick the central C-C bond:<br />
      <br /></li>
      <li>Calculate the energy profile:

<p class="indent_novspace"><span class="menu">Footer | <img src=
        "mogul/plot.png" style="vertical-align:middle;" /></span></p><br />
      </li>
    </ol>The energy profile appears in a popup. If Mogul is available, as
    either a local executable or via MOE/web, the dihedrals spanning the
    selected bond are analyzed and their resulting histograms are combined and
    added to the energy profile. In this case there are thousands of fragments
    in the Mogul database for this geometric parameter so the histogram counts
    are scaled to the [0,&nbsp;10] scale used for strain energy. Notice that
    there is excellent correspondence between the energy curve and the
    histogram data:

<img src="mogul/biotinbond2.png" alt=
    "Biotin Dihedral 1" class="center" />Note that the energy minima correspond, for the
    most part, to the histogram maxima. The crystal structures tend to occur in
    lower-energy conformations. The asymmetry of the energy curve is due to
    more distant steric interactions of this particular structure.

<p>The Pharmacophore Query Editor is used to specify a query consisting of a
  set of constraints on the location and type of ligand annotations. This can
  be used to search for matches in a conformation database or act as a filter
  in various applications. The main characteristics of the Pharmacophore Query
  Editor are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Interactive Modification</b>. The positions, radii and other
    characteristics of the pharmacophore query can be interactively
    adjusted.</li>
    <li><b>Template Ligand</b>. A ligand (possibly in complex with a receptor)
    can optionally be used as a &quot;template&quot; to simplify defining the
    features of a query.</li>
    <li><b>Template Receptor</b>. A receptor can optionally be used to help
    identify key interactions or as a template to simplify defining excluded
    volume constraints or other shape constraints.</li>
    <li><b>Custom Rendering</b>. The visual characteristics (like color) of the
    displayed query features and volumes can be individually adjusted. The
    annotation points of template molecules can be customized.</li>
  </ul>

<p>In this document we present an overview of the Pharmacophore Query Editor
  and the steps required to construct a 3D Pharmacophore Query. The following
  terms are used:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A <i>ligand annotation</i> is a set of points in space with attached
    labels that reflect the presence or absence of pharmacophore features at
    those locations. Each ligand conformation in a database is annotated on the
    fly during the search. These annotations are what the Pharmacophore Search
    procedure &quot;sees&quot; during a search.</li>
    <li>A <i>pharmacophore annotation scheme</i>, or more simply a
    <i>scheme</i>, is an automatic procedure to compute the pharmacophore
    annotation points that make up a ligand annotation. MOE contains a number
    of schemes encoding different methods of ligand annotation.</li>
    <li>A <i>pharmacophore query</i> is a collection of restrictions imposed on
    ligand annotations calculated for the atoms of a molecule. The purpose of
    the query is to select a limited subset from a given set of ligand
    conformations such that all restrictions of the query are satisfied.</li>
    <li>A <i>match</i> (or <i>hit</i>) is the occurrence of a ligand
    conformation satisfying a query. A match is the successful mapping of the
    query features to ligand annotation points, including the corresponding
    alignment of the ligand with the query such that all restrictions of the
    query are satisfied. In general, there can be many different ways in which
    a given query can match a ligand.</li>
    <li>The <i>H-bond interaction energy</i> is a measure (in kcal/mol) of the
    interaction between ligand annotation points and their associated receptor
    annotations. This is used in the <tt>EHT</tt> annotation scheme.</li>
  </ul>

<p>The Pharmacophore Query Editor is used to create and edit pharmacophore
  queries that are based on a particular <a href="ph4_annot.htm">Pharmacophore
  Annotation Scheme</a>. The scheme provides the definitions of ligand
  annotations, for example H-bond donor, acceptor and hydrophobe, and
  conditions such as the <a href="ph4_annot.htm#Exposure">Solvent Exposure
  Test</a>. A query consists of <i>features</i>, <i>group constraints</i>, and
  <i>volumes</i>, as described below. Using <a href=
  "#ConsensusMethod">Pharmacophore Consensus</a>, a set of aligned molecules
  can be used to suggest a consensus set of pharmacophore query features which
  can be visually examined and then selectively added to a query.</p>
  <!-- =================== FEATURES, VOLUMES & CONSTRAINTS ================= !-->
<a id="Features"></a>
<h1>Features</h1>

<p>Features are added to the current query with the Pharmacophore Query
  Editor. The new feature is specified as a location in space, a radius, and an
  expression. The location and radius are depicted in the MOE Window as a
  sphere. If there are selected atoms, the new feature is automatically
  positioned at their centroid. If there are no atoms selected, the new feature
  is positioned at the center of the MOE Window. The sphere determines a volume
  of space in which the center of any &quot;matching&quot; ligand feature must
  be located. There are two different any type features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>AtomQ</b> for any heavy atom (the default feature type).</li>
    <li><b>AtomL</b> for any lone pair or hydrogen.</li>
  </ul>

<p>These should be used to match any atom or lone pair. The any type feature
  <b>Any</b> in MOE versions prior to 2009 is obsolete and treated as an
  <b>AtomQ</b> feature.</p>

<p>It is often desirable to design a query that would match database ligands
  that share some pharmacophoric features with a given template ligand or
  ligands. If such templates are present in the system and their annotation
  points are selected, the editor will automatically position the new feature
  at the center of the selected annotation points. The associated expression
  will be set to a combination derived from the labels attached to the selected
  annotation points.</p>

<p>The pictures below illustrate the use of a ligand template. The left
  picture shows a ligand in the MOE Window with the small spheres indicating
  each of its annotation points. Assume that the ligand annotation point at the
  center of the aromatic ring is selected when the feature is created. The
  right picture shows a sphere representing the query feature that is created.
  Observe that its center is located at the center of the aromatic ring.</p>

  <div class="center">
      <img src="ph4_query/lig2.png" alt="Ligand not annotated" class="icon" />
  <img src="ph4_query/lig3.png" alt="Ligand annotated" class="icon" />
</div>

<p>When a ligand template is no longer needed it can be deleted.</p>

<p>The features of the current query are presented in the list area of the
  Pharmacophore Query Editor. For example, a feature from a ligand template
  atom selection that includes an H-bond donor, H-bond acceptor and a
  hydrophobe would appear as:</p>

<pre>
    F1     Don|Acc|Hyd
</pre>

<p>This defines query feature <tt>F1</tt> (the name is assigned
  automatically) that has a feature expression of <tt>Don|Acc|Hyd</tt>. For a
  ligand conformation to match this query, it must include a ligand annotation
  point that is positioned within the volume of <tt>F1</tt> whose attached
  labels include at least one of Donor, Acceptor or Hydrophobe. By default,
  feature spheres are rendered in line mode and colored by their annotation
  type. This can be changed via the GUI as desired. The editable attributes of
  a feature include the feature expression, essential attribute, color, radius,
  position and appearance. Features may be set to be ignored during the search
  or hidden from the display. Note that features and volumes (described below)
  share common attributes and may be modified at the same time by selecting
  them in the list area. In such cases, available attributes will be applied to
  the selected objects where they can be applied. For example, the
  <tt>essential</tt> checkbox will apply to all selected features leaving the
  volumes unchanged.
<a id="Volumes"></a>
</p>

<h1>Volumes</h1>

<p>Volumes are added to the current query with the Pharmacophore Query
  Editor. They are spatial constraints imposed on selected atoms of the ligand
  molecule. The position and shape of a volume is defined by a single sphere or
  a union of several spheres. The volume's function is determined by its
  expression and type; the expression determine which atoms of the ligand are
  involved and the type indicates how they are constrained.</p>

<p>When created, the new volume is added to the list area and given an
  automatically-generated name. If the volume consists of several spheres, a
  <b>+</b> sign is shown to the left of the volume entry showing it can be
  <i>opened</i> to access the individual spheres. For example, if the first
  volume is created from three atoms, the following appears in the list
  area:</p>

<pre class="code oneline">
+V1     Excl
</pre>

<p>Double-clicking on the volume entry in the list area will open the
  volume:</p>

<pre class="code">
V1     Excl
:      Sphere 1
:      Sphere 2
:      Sphere 3
</pre>

<p>The volume can be closed by double-clicking on the volume entry.
<a id="Constraints"></a>
</p>

<h1>Constraints</h1>

<p>Constraints are added to the current query with the Pharmacophore Query
  Editor. To create a new group constraint, select one or more query features
  in the list area. Pressing the <b>Constraint</b> button will create a
  constraint that applies to all of the selected features. A line is added in
  the list area giving the constraint name, its type and the names of the
  features that it affects. For example, if the first constraint is created
  involving features <tt>F2</tt> and <tt>F3</tt>, the following line
  appears:</p>

<pre class="code oneline">
C1     At Least One   F[2,3]
</pre>

<p>This defines constraint <tt>C1</tt> (the name is assigned automatically),
  which has a constraint type of &quot;At Least One&quot;. This means that a
  conformation must match at least one of query features <tt>F2</tt> and
  <tt>F3</tt> in order for there to be an overall match to the query.
<a id="ConsensusMethod"></a>
</p>

<h1>Pharmacophore Consensus Methodology</h1>

<p>Given a set of aligned molecular conformations, the maximum distance
  between points considered neighbors, <tt>T</tt>, and a minimum consensus
  score to retain a group points, <tt>C</tt>, Pharmacophore Consensus generates
  a set of suggested features. These have a position, radius and a type
  expression. For each conformation:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Calculate (or read precomputed) annotation points.<br />
    <br /></li>
    <li>For each annotation point:
      <ul>
        <li>Find all neighbors, annotation points that are within <tt>T</tt>
        from that point.</li>
        <li>Calculate the consensus score for the set consisting of the point
        and its neighbors.</li>
        <li>Eliminate points with a consensus score below the threshold,
        <tt>C</tt>.</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>
    <li>Define a graph with the remaining points as its vertices. The edges of
    the graph connect points that are within <tt>C</tt> of each other.
      <ul>
        <li>Find the connected components (single-linkage clusters) of the
        graph.</li>
        <li>Calculate the consensus score for each component.</li>
        <li>Eliminate components with the consensus score below
        <tt>C</tt>.</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>
    <li>For each remaining component, generate one suggested feature. The
    consensus score of the component will become the consensus score of the
    suggested feature. For each suggested feature:
      <ul>
        <li>Set the feature position at the centroid of the component,
        calculated with equal weight for all points of the component.</li>
        <li>Set the feature radius to the distance from the centroid to the
        farthest point of the component, with the addition of a buffer-distance
        of 0.5 &Aring;.</li>
        <li>Set the feature expression as appropriate.</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>
    <li>Sort the features by their consensus score. Features of equal scores
    are sorted by secondary keys in order: radius, number of molecules, number
    of conformations, length of the expression and alphabetical sequence.</li>
  </ol>

<p>Note that the consensus score threshold, <tt>C</tt>, is used <i>twice</i>:
  to eliminate individual annotation points as well as to eliminate components
  (clusters) of annotation points. Therefore, increasing the value of
  <tt>C</tt> to a given value <i>x</i> may eliminate even those suggested
  features whose current consensus score is greater than <i>x</i>.</p>

<p>The expression for a suggested feature is derived as follows:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Find the labels, <i>L</i><sub>0,1</sub>, <i>L</i><sub>0,2</sub>, ...
    <i>L</i><sub>0,<i>N</i><sub>0</sub></sub>, that are attached (common) to
    <i>all</i> points in the set. Remove those labels from further
    consideration. Concatenate these labels using the <i>AND</i> operator
    (<tt>&amp;</tt>) as a separator:

<p class="center"><nobr><i>A</i> = <i>L</i><sub>0,1</sub> &amp;
      <i>L</i><sub>0,2</sub> &amp; ...
      <i>L</i><sub>0,<i>N</i><sub>0</sub></sub></nobr></p>
    </li>
    <li>Iterate for <i>j</i>=1,2...:
      <ul>
        <li>If the set of remaining labels is empty, go to step 3.</li>
        <li>Among the remaining labels, find the label,
        <i>L</i><sub><i>j</i></sub><sub>,1</sub>, attached to most points in
        the set.</li>
        <li>Find the labels, <i>L</i><sub><i>j</i></sub><sub>,2</sub>,
        <i>L</i><sub><i>j</i></sub><sub>,3</sub>, ...
        <i>L</i><sub><i>j,N<sub>j</sub></i></sub>, that are attached to the
        same points as the label <i>L</i><sub><i>j</i></sub><sub>,1</sub>.</li>
        <li>Concatenate all labels found using the <i>AND</i> operator
        (<tt>&amp;</tt>) as a separator:

<p class="center"><nobr><i>B<sub>j</sub></i> =
          <i>L</i><sub><i>j</i></sub><sub>,1</sub> &amp;
          <i>L</i><sub><i>j</i></sub><sub>,2</sub> &amp; ...
          <i>L</i><sub><i>j,N<sub>j</sub></i></sub></nobr></p>
        </li>
        <li>Remove the labels found from further consideration.</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>
    <li>Concatenate all expressions <i>B<sub>j</sub></i>
    (<i>j</i>=1,2...<i>K</i>) created in Step 2 using the <i>OR</i> operator
    (<tt>|</tt>) as a separator:

<p class="center"><nobr><i>B</i> = <i>B</i><sub>1</sub> |
      <i>B</i><sub>2</sub> | ... <i>B<sub>K</sub></i></nobr></p>
    </li>
    <li>Combine expressions <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> created in Step 1 and Step 2:
      <ul>
        <li>If <i>A</i> is empty, return <nobr><b>Expression</b> =
        <i>B</i>.</nobr></li>
        <li>If <i>B</i> is empty, return <nobr><b>Expression</b> =
        <i>A</i>.</nobr></li>
        <li>If neither <i>A</i> nor <i>B</i> is empty, concatenate <i>A</i> and
        <i>B</i> using the <i>AND</i> operator (<tt>&amp;</tt>) as a separator:

<p class="center"><nobr><b>Expression</b> = <i>A</i> &amp;
          (<i>B</i>)</nobr></p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

<p>The final expression for each suggested feature is provided in the panel.

<h1>Running The Pharmacophore Query Editor</h1>

<p>The Pharmacophore Query Editor is used to create and modify pharmacophore
  queries. A query consists of <i>features, group constraints</i> and
  <i>volumes</i>. Queries can be saved in files and used later for searching
  databases of ligand conformations using the <a href=
  "ph4_search.htm">Pharmacophore Search</a> application. The Pharmacophore
  Query Editor can be opened using one of the following methods:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>From the MOE window, choose <span class="menu">MOE | Compute |
    Pharmacophore | Query Editor</span>.</li>
    <li>From the MOE window, choose <span class="menu">MOE | File | New |
    Pharmacophore Query</span>.</li>
    <li>Using the <a href="../moe/gui/fileopen.htm">Open panel</a>, select an
    existing pharmacophore query file and set <b>Action</b> to <span class=
    "nobr"><b>Edit Pharmacophore</b></span>. By convention, such files have the
    extension <tt>.ph4</tt>.
    </li>
    <li>From the Pharmacophore Search panel, press the <b>Edit</b> button.</li>
  </ul>

<p>If there are atoms present in the system, the editor will calculate and
  display ligand annotation points using the pharmacophore scheme specified in
  the panel. This is shown in the two pictures below: the left shows a molecule
  without any annotation and the right is annotated by the Unified
  pharmacophore scheme.</p>

  <div class="center">
<img src="ph4_query/ligand.png" alt="Ligand" class="icon"/>
<img src="ph4_query/lig2.png" alt="Ligand annotated" class="icon" />
  </div>

<p>Dummy atoms are used in the MOE Window to display ligand annotation
  points, query features and volumes. Selections of query features and volumes
  in the Pharmacophore Query Editor and the corresponding dummy atoms in the
  MOE window are synchronized. Selecting a feature or volume in the editor
  automatically selects all associated dummy atoms and residues while
  deselecting all others. Similarly, selecting or deselecting a query feature
  or volume in the MOE Window will select or deselect that feature or volume in
  the Pharmacophore Query Editor. Selection of other atoms or residues is not
  affected. A new Pharmacophore Query Editor panel will appear:</p>

<h1>Running Pharmacophore Consensus</h1>

<p>Pharmacophore Consensus is used to generate suggested features for a
  pharmacophore query from a set of aligned structures. These features can be
  converted into query features as desired. Pressing <b>Consensus</b> in the
  Pharmacophore Query Editor panel brings up the following panel:</p>

<img src="ph4_query/consensus.png" alt=
  "Pharmacophore Consensus Panel" class="center" />
  <table class="noborder">
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><b>Input</b></td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><b>Active</b></td>
      <td valign="top">The set of atoms or chains considered active by the
      consensus calculation. Choose one of <span class="nobr"><b>Visible
      Atoms</b></span>, <span class="nobr"><b>Selected Chains</b></span> or

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><b>Database</b></td>
      <td valign="top">The name of the input database (if used). The input

      threshold are considered inactive.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><b>Tolerance</b></td>
      <td valign="top">The neighborhood distance threshold. Annotation points

      The regions are defined by annotation point neighborhoods, determined by
      the tolerance threshold. A group of annotation points will become a
      suggested features only if: (1) It is composed of overlapping annotation
      point neighborhoods, (2) the consensus score of each neighborhood exceeds
      the score threshold and (3) the consensus score of the entire group
      exceeds the score threshold. The consensus score of the groups of points

      below.</td>

    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><b>Consensus Score</b></td>
      <td valign="top">The consensus score method. The score is a measure of

      points. Three methods are available: <span class="nobr"><b>First
      Conformation Per Molecule</b></span> counts the number of distinct
      structures, <span class="nobr"><b>Unweighted Conformations</b></span>
      counts the number of distinct conformations and <span class=
      "nobr"><b>Weighted Conformations</b></span> accumulates the weighted sum
      of distinct conformations. The weights are the inverse of the number of
      conformations per structure.</td>

<p>Press <b>Calculate</b> to start the Pharmacophore Consensus calculation.
  Once the calculation completes, the list of suggested features is provided in
  the panel:</p>

<img src="ph4_query/consensus_bot.png" class="center" />

<p>Each suggested features is given a name of the form <b>G<i>n</i></b>,
  where <i>n</i> is the feature index, to identify the feature in the MOE
  Window. Selecting a list entry will display that feature in the MOE Window,
  where they can be compared with features already present in the query. If
  desired, a suggested feature can be added to the query by selecting it in the
  list and pressing the <span class="nobr"><b>Load Selected</b></span> button.
  All selected features will be added to the query.

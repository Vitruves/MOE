<a id="Introduction"></a>
<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
There are two main categories of algorithms for describing molecular
properties as a function of constituent atoms, their connectivity, and
their positions. The simpler of the two is the classical forcefield
method, in which the <span class="nobr"><q>ball &amp; spring</q></span>
metaphor is applied to atoms and bonds, using parameters trained to reproduce
quantitative data. The calculation of potential energy and gradients is
computationally efficient, allowing discovery of minimum energy geometries of
huge molecular species such as proteins.  These calculations are typically
known as Molecular Mechanics (MM).
</p>

<p>
The other main category is the quantum chemical (QM) method, which starts by
assigning to each atom a set of atomic orbitals (comprised of basis
functions), and a number of electrons to populate them.  Given this and
the atomic positions, one of the many theoretical approaches can be used to
determine the wavefunction for the molecule (the solution of the
Schr&ouml;dinger Equation).  Various atomic and molecular properties can
then be determined from the wavefunction as needed.
</p>

<p>
Compared to the use of forcefields, calculation of molecular properties
using wavefunction-based methods is computationally intensive, with a
(very) strong molecular size dependence.  Theoretical approaches include
semi-empirical, Hartree-Fock, Density Functional Theory (DFT) and
post-Hartree-Fock methods.  The level of approximation, and thus the time
required to perform a calculation, is chosen to yield the desired
information with the least effort.  Fortunately, these approaches are
amenable to multi-processor calculations.
</p>

<a id="ONIOM"></a>
<h2>ONIOM (QM/MM)</h2>
<p>
Large systems, such as ligand/pocket complexes, can be treated by QM/MM
methods.  In this, a (small) region of interest (the inner layer) &ndash;
for example,
the locus of charge transfer or bond making/breaking, i.e. "where
chemistry occurs" &ndash; is treated quantum-chemically,
while the rest of the system
(the outer layer) is modeled by a forcefield.  In complex systems,
a middle layer might be included that is treated quantum-chemically using a
lower level of theory.
Determining the 
complex energy or minimized geometry using this heterogeneous
approach can gain a significant reduction in computation time over
treating all atoms with QM.
</p>

<p>
The ONIOM approach ([Vreven&nbsp;2005] and
references therein) is one way of implementing such calculations.
The HDAC8 complex provides an example of how the molecular system
might be partitioned:
</p>

<img src="qmconfig/oniom_hdac8.png" alt="ONIOM Partitioning" class="center" />

<p>
Here, the inner region has been specified as the zinc ion plus atoms up to
2 angstroms away.  The yellow region highlights this inner layer, including
any adjustments
necessary to satisfy partitioning rules, and which will be treated at the 
highest level of theory.  The blue region is the middle layer, which will
be optimized at a lower level of theory (such as semi-empirical).  The remaining
atoms constitute the outer layer, which will be
treated via a forcefield.  The ONIOM method, as implemented in the third-party
QM engine, performs the necessary calculations in each layer to create an
overall solution for the system.  As it is an approximate method, some
properties of the system are unavailable.
</p>

<p>
For a two-layer ONIOM calculation, three separate subcalculations are
performed:
<ol>
<li>The full system using a forcefield, yielding <tt>E_RealLow</tt>.</li>
<li>The inner layer using a QM method, yielding <tt>E_ModelHigh</tt>.</li>
<li>The inner layer using a forcefield, yielding <tt>E_ModelLow</tt>.</li>
</ol>
<br />
These subcalculations are used to obtain the ONIOM energy:
<br /></br>
<span class="nobr"><tt>E_ONIOM = E_RealLow - E_ModelLow + E_ModelHigh.
</tt></span><br /><br />
Three-layer ONIOM involves more subcalculations, but the principle is
the same, and the overall ONIOM energy is calculated in a fashion
similar to that of the two-layer case.

<h1>QM Calculation Options</h1>
</a>

<p>
This is the setup panel for MOE applications that use quantum chemical
methods.  It specifies the QM Engine and the various settings and keywords
needed to perform the calculation.  The name of the associated application
is included in the window title.  Pressing the configure icon brings up
the panel:</p>

default, MOPAC is selected (and distributed with MOE). See
<a href="#QMEngines">Supported QM Engines</a> below for more
information. The configure icon, if supported by the QM engine, provides
an easier means of setting the RC settings required to run the external
application.  While all engines have significant feature overlap, changing
the engine will cause menus to change and unsupported options to be
insensitive.

<h2>Running QM Calculations</h2>

<p>
Quantum chemical calculations (using third-party software packages) can
take a significant amount of time to complete. This is particularly true when
spectral properties such as NMR, VCD or spin-spin coupling constants are
being generated. These calculations can be run within MOE, using MOE/web
or on large-scale
clusters external to MOE. Either way, the results can then be imported into
MOE and the appropriate database updated. This is controlled by the
<span class="menu">DBV | Compute | QM</span> menu items of the (empty) output
database created by applications such as
<a href="confsrch.htm"><span class="nobr">
<b>Conformation Search</b></span></a>,
<a href="emin.htm#DBMin">
<span class="nobr"><b>Energy Minimization</b></span></a> or
<a href="torprofile.htm"><span class="nobr"><b>Torsion Profile</b></a>.
</p>

<a id="RunInMOE"></a>
<h3>Running within MOE</h3>

<p>
These applications will run the calculation(s) under MOE's control if the
user presses <b>OK</b>.  The calculation's settings and
working directories are associated with the output database.
If MOE (or MOE/web) is MPU-enabled, multiple calculations will be run
simultaneously. Progress can be tracked in the <span class="nobr"><b>SVL
Commands</b></span> window, as well as status fields in the database as
appropriate. MOE must remain active while performing these calculations. When
the calculation is completed, the results can be imported into the database
(see <a href="#QMimport">below</a>). A worked example can be found <a href=
"spectralanalysis.htm#QMinMOE">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
For example, if the default name of <tt>csearch.mdb</tt> was used for a
Conformation Search with QM refinement, the database <tt>csearch_qm.mdb</tt>
will be created with the necessary settings and the directory
<tt>csearch_qm_conffiles</tt> will be created with the necessary input
files and shell scripts.
Each subdirectory in <tt>csearch_qm_conffiles</tt> corresponds
to an entry in <tt>csearch_qm.mdb</tt>, and must contain all information
associated (input and output) with this entry's calculation.  These
directories are created after the forcefield-based calculation has completed.
</p>

<a id="RunOutsideMOE"></a>
<h3>Running Outside of MOE</h3>

<p>
Pressing <b>Batch</b> carries out any calculation performed by MOE
(e.g. in Conformation Search) and then writes out
the information needed to run the QM portion outside of MOE
to a job directory, along with the
data needed to create the output database (or update the input
database).  When external QM calculations
are performed, the job directory also contains the working subdirectory for
each row of the output database.  These subdirectories, if kept, contain
the input file(s) passed to the external program and all of the output
that was generated.
The QM calculations can be started from the output database via
<span class="menu">DBV | Compute | QM | Run</span>. This will launch the
calculations using the settings and directories associated with the
output database.  The calculation can also be run outside MOE by
executing the shell script in the job directory.
</p>

<p>
For supported QM engines such as Gaussian, the entire calculation can be
carried out on a remote <a href="../moe/hpc.htm">queueing system</a>.
The <b>Batch</b> button opens the
<a href="../moe/hpc.htm#BatchPanel">Batch</a> job submit panel,
where the information needed to run the calculation
outside of MOE can be provided.  In this case the remote job will consist
of a moebatch process which will write out the job directory as described
above and then submit the QM refinement jobs individually to the queueing
system.  In the case of Gaussian, the Keywords provided in the
<a href="#QMCalcOptions">Calculation Options</a> will be used to submit
the jobs with the required number of CPUs and amount of memory to run
correctly.  In this case the remote job will also automatically import
the QM results into the appropriate output database after all QM jobs
have completed.
</p>

<a id="QMimport"></a>
<h3>Importing QM results</h3>

<p>
When the QM calculation has completed without updating the output
database, the results can be imported into
the currently active database by selecting <span class="menu">DBV | Compute |
QM | Import</span>. This will load the application-specific information
generated by the QM package into the appropriate fields; these were created
by the application that generated the database. If <span class="nobr"><b>Keep
QM Files</b></span> was specified when the calculation was set up, the input
and output files will be retained, otherwise for successful calculations
they will be
deleted.  Note that the output files must be present in the MOE-created
subdirectory to import the data into the database.
</p>

<a id="QMEngines"></a>
<h1>Supported QM Engines</h1>
<p>
MOE includes support for several QM engines, each of which provides an
interface to an external package.  Specific configuration settings, as
described below, may be required in order to run these applications.
MOE can use the data that has been calculated using one of these engines
even if the application itself is not locally installed.

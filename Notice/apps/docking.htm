<a id="Introduction">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
</a>

<p>Docking is a computer simulation technique used to predict the preferred
orientation of two interacting chemical species. Usually, this is the
interaction of a small- to medium-sized molecule with a protein (molecular
docking), but in recent years the concept has been expanded to
protein-protein, protein-antibody, and protein-receptor interactions as well
(macromolecular docking). Docking remains a critically important tool in the
structure-based drug design process. In its most general sense, the docking
process involves positioning various conformations (and potentially
tautomeric forms) of one molecule with respect to another and determining the
optimal interaction geometry and its associated energy.</p>

<p>MOE's Dock application searches for favorable <i>binding modes</i>
between small- to medium-sized ligands and a not-too-flexible macromolecular
target, which is usually a protein. For each ligand, a number of placements
called <i>poses</i> are generated and scored. If desired, the poses can be
covalently bound to a receptor side-chain atom. The score can be calculated
as either a free energy of binding including, among other contributions,
solvation and entropy terms, or enthalpy terms based on polar interaction
interaction energies (including metal ligation) or as qualitative
shaped-based numerical value. Poses can be optionally constrained to fit a
pharmacophore query, and final filtering by pharmacophore query is also
possible. The atoms of the active site can be permitted to move: sidechains
can be tethered, but backbone atoms are always fixed. The final highest
scoring poses, along with their scores and conformation energies, are written
to a database where they are ready for further analysis.</p>

<p>The Dock application was designed for flexibility and customizability. The
algorithm that is executed is arranged as a series of self-contained stages,
each of which may be bypassed if desired. As a result, the application can
also be used to rescore or refine poses resulting from earlier Dock runs, or
even from other docking applications. At most stages, there is a choice from
among multiple methods. The GOLD, Surflex, and Flex* docking programs, if
available, have been seamlessly integrated into the Dock framework as initial
placement methods.</p>


<a id="Methodology_Overview">
<h1>Methodology Overview</h1>
</a>

<p>The Dock workflow begins with a <a href="#Preparing_the_Receptor">prepared
receptor</a> and <a href="#Preparing_the_Ligand">ligand</a> loaded in MOE.
The general algorithm is divided into stages, as illustrated in the diagram
below. For each stage, multiple methods are available:</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> The search for binding modes is usually constrained to a
specific, small region of the receptor &ndash; the active site, here simply
referred to as the <i>site</i>. As one would expect, the predictive power of
Dock correlates with the degrees of freedom of the system. Docking results
are expected to be reliable when the ligands are molecules with limited
flexibility and the site is not significantly larger than the ligand. Ligands
having up to 10 rotatable bonds can be handled reasonably.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="docking/Workflow.png" alt=
"Stages in the Docking Algorithm" /><br />
<i>Stages in the Dock Algorithm</i></p>

<ol>
  <li> <a id="Conformational_Analysis"></a><i>Conformational Analysis</i>. If
  ligand conformations are not supplied via a conformation database,
  conformations can be generated by <span class="nobr"><a
  href="confgui.htm">Conformation Import</a></span> via a fragment-based
  approach or from a single 3D conformer by applying a collection of preferred
  torsion angles to the rotatable bonds. In the latter case, bond lengths and
  bond angles will not be altered and rings will not be flexed, hence it is
  important that the starting conformation have a reasonable geometry.</li>

<!--
  Dock can be used to generate conformations from a single 3D conformation by
  applying a collection of preferred torsion angles to the rotatable bonds. A
  systematic search is conducted covering all combinations of angles on a grid
  if this will result in under 5000 conformers. Otherwise, a stochastic
  sampling of conformations is conducted.  Bond lengths and bond angles will
  not be altered from the starting conformation, hence it is important that the
  starting conformation has a reasonable geometry. Also, as of now, rings will
  not be flexed. A thorough treatment of the different ring conformations
  requires that they be pre-generated before being fed into Dock.
-->

  <li><i>Pharmacophore Pre-filtering and Pre-placement</i>. The
  user may provide a pharmacophore for filtering the conformations prior
  to placement.  Conformations that pass the filtering step are
  superposed onto the pharmacophore query to have a more favorable starting
  position coming into the placement step.
  If a pharmacophore is supplied,
  Pharmacophore is the recommended placement method of choice.
  Note that Volume pharmacophore constraints are applied only at the
  final filtering stage.</li>

  <li><i>Placement</i>. A collection of poses is generated from the pool of
  ligand conformations using one of the placement methods. The bonds between
  the site and covalent ligands (if desired) are constructed at this point.
  Each of the generated poses is assigned a score.</li>

  <li><i>Initial Scoring</i>. Poses generated by the placement methodology
  can be rescored using one of the available methods. Typically, scoring
  functions emphasize favorable hydrophobic, ionic and hydrogen bond
  contacts. For the Dock framework to work properly, all new scoring methods
  must assign low scores to good poses.</li>

  <li><i>Refinement</i>. Poses resulting from the placement stage can be
  refined using either the explicit molecular mechanics forcefield method or
  the grid-based energetics method.</li>

  <li><i>Pharmacophore Constraints</i>. The user may provide a pharmacophore
  to constrain the final poses. If a pharmacophore constraint is provided,
  Pharmacophore is the placement method of choice.
  Note that Volume pharmacophore constraints are applied only at the
  final filtering stage.</li>

  <li><i>Final Scoring</i>. The final poses can be rescored using one of
  several scoring schemes.</li>
</ol>

<p>The top scoring poses are output, subject to optional duplicate removal.</p>

<p>It is possible to perform rescoring or further refinement of existing
docking results by using the output database from an earlier Dock Run as the
source for the input ligands, and setting the placement step to None. Note that
any such refinement would use the receptor as defined in the Dock panel rather
than one stored in the database.</p>

    than two pharmacophore features and they do not lie on or close to a
    straight line, the pharmacophore search engine is used to orient the
    ligand.  If the pharmacophore features lie on or very close to a line, the
    ligand is anchored by the pharmacophore features and rotated such that a
    third atom matches an alpha site point.  If all pharmacophore features lie
    at a point or very close to one point, the ligand is first anchored at that
    point. Then, two more atoms on the ligand are matched to two alpha site
    points to orient the ligand.  Since the ligand pose changes upon
    refinement, if there is a refinement stage, the pharmacophore constraints
    are loosened for placement. Furthermore, if a pharmacophore search returns
    too few hits, the pharmacophore constraints are further loosened so that
    more hits are obtained. </td>

<p><b>Note!</b> While the placement stage produces identical results under
identical set up conditions, it is normal for the output to vary from run to
run if there is a refinement stage or if <span class="nobr"><b>Conformation

nature of the energy minimization process.</p>

<a id="Pharmacophore_Constraint">
<h2>Pharmacophore Constraint</h2>
</a>

<p>To facilitate the use of known interactions to guide the docking process,
a <a href="ph4_guide.htm">pharmacophore query</a> (either from a MOE
pharmacophore file or from a <a href="ph4_query.htm">Pharmacophore Query
Editor</a>) may be specified. All final poses (after the refinement stage, if
there is one) that do not satisfy the pharmacophore (in absolute mode) will
be eliminated.</p>

<p>If a pharmacophore is specified, the pharmacophore placement method is the
method of choice. If another placement method (available under the
<b>General</b> docking protocol) is used, the final poses will still be
filtered using the pharmacophore, but the process is likely to be less
efficient.</p>

<p>If the pharmacophore was defined using the <a href="ph4_annot.htm">Unified
Annotation Scheme</a>, restraints will be applied during refinement to keep
the poses reasonably close to the pharmacophore model. It is possible,
especially for pharmacophore models defined using other annotation schemes,
for poses to move away from the pharmacophore during refinement.</p>

<a id="Alpha_HB_Scoring">
<h3>Alpha HB Scoring</h3>
</a>

<p>This score is a linear combination of two terms. The first term measures the
geometric fit of the ligand to the binding site. The second term measures
hydrogen bonding effects. Both terms are summed over all ligand atoms.</p>

<p>The first term has an attractive component and a repulsive component. The
attractive component is summed over atoms in the ligand. Each ligand atom that
is within 3 &Aring; of an alpha sphere center contributes
<i>Ae<sup>-d<sup>2</sup>/2</sup></i> to this term, where <i>d</i> is the
distance from the ligand atom to the nearest alpha sphere center, and <i>A</i>
assumes the value of -0.6845. The repulsive component is summed over all pairs
of atomic overlap between the ligand and the receptor. For each pair of
overlap, the contribution is between 0 and 1 depending on the severity of the
overlap.</p>

<p>The second term measures hydrogen bond effects. For non-<i>sp3</i> donors
and acceptors, hydrogen bonding sites are projected from the atom. If the site
is occupied by a favorable atom, there is a score of <tt>-</tt>2 (negative
means favorable). Otherwise, if it is occupied by some other ligand atom, there
is a score of +1. For <i>sp3</i> donors and acceptors, all favorable atoms
within <span class="nobr">3.5 &Aring;</span> contribute a score of <tt>-</tt>1
while all other atoms contribute +1. Metals in the receptor are treated as
acceptors but with a three-fold effect.</p>

<a id="London_dG_Scoring">
<h3>London dG Scoring</h3>
</a>

<p>The London dG scoring function estimates the free energy of binding of the
  ligand from a given pose. The functional form is a sum of terms:
<!-- <span class="LaTeX">\[
\begin{equation}
\Delta G
    = c + E_{\mathrm{flex}}
        + \sum_{h-bonds} c_{HB} f_{HB}

\end{equation}
\]</span> --></p>

<p class="center"><img src="docking/math_docking_eq1.png" /></p>

<p>where <i>c</i> represents the average gain/loss of rotational and
  translational entropy; <i>E<sub>flex</sub></i> is the energy due to the loss
  of flexibility of the ligand (calculated from ligand topology only);
  <i>f</i><sub>HB</sub> measures geometric imperfections of hydrogen bonds and
  takes a value in [0,1]; <i>c</i><sub>HB</sub> is the energy of an ideal
  hydrogen bond; <i>f</i><sub>M</sub> measures geometric imperfections of metal
  ligations and takes a value in [0,1]; <i>c</i><sub>M</sub> is the energy of
  an ideal metal ligation; and <i>D<sub>i</sub></i> is the desolvation energy

<h3>Electron Density Scoring</h3>
</a>

<p>The Dock electron density placement method is based on alpha spheres.
First, peaks are detected in the input electron density grid and these
positions are used to create additional alpha spheres to complement those
generated during the placement phase. Peaks are identified as locations where
&nabla;<i>x</i>=0. These are typically not coincident with grid points, and
must be calculated. All grid points where the density is greater than
1.5<i>&sigma;</i> and &nabla;<sup>2</sup><i>x&lt;</i>0 are located, and to
those where the density is greater than that of all six neighbors, the
truncated Newton method is applied to find the nearest maximum. After duplicate
removal, the resulting maxima constitute the set of identified peaks, which
ideally correspond to the locations of atoms within the density.</p>

<p>For the refinement phase of docking, to calculate how well a particular
conformation matches the given electron density data, the simulated density of
the input molecular conformation is convolved with the electron density grid.
This gives a density correlation score which is higher when the atom positions
fit well into the density, and is small when they do not. Density is simulated
using a two-Gaussian approximation based on the method described in [Agarwal
1978]. For atom types not covered by that reference, the three-Gaussian model
of [Eyck 1977] is used. Note that isotropic B factors are necessary to
accurately reproduce the density using this method, so an average B factor of
25 is used for all atoms. In this way, the electron density contribution at a
given position <i>r</i> from an atom is given by:

  <!-- <span class="LaTeX">\[
\begin{equation*}
\rho(r) = \sum_i Z_i \left| 4 \pi D_i \right| ^\frac{1}{2}
exp(-4 \pi^2 r^T D_i r)
\end{equation*}
\]</span> --></p>

<p class="center"><img src="docking/math_docking_eq16.png" /></p>

<p>where the sum is over the <i>i</i> Gaussians and || is the determinant
operation.</p>

<p>In order to compare an experimental density, <i>F</i>, with a simulated one,
<i>G</i>, they must first be scaled correctly. In general, we wish to minimize
the squared error between (<i>aG</i>+<i>b</i>) and <i>F</i>:

  <!-- <span class="LaTeX">\[
\begin{equation*}
\underset{a,b}{\operatorname{argmin}} \int\left[ a G(x) + b - F(x) \right]^2 dx
\end{equation*}
\]</span> --></p>

<p class="center"><img src="docking/math_docking_eq19.png" /></p>

<p>Without loss of generality, we may assume that <i>F</i> and <i>G</i> have

<p>Replacing the optimal <i>b</i> we can write the optimal scaling <i>a</i> as
<!-- <span class="LaTeX">\[

\underset{a}{\operatorname{argmin}} \int\left[ a\,G(x) - F(x) \right] ^2 dx
\end{equation*}
\]</span> --></p>

<p class="center"><img src="docking/math_docking_eq21.png" /></p>

<p>Differentiating by <i>a</i> and solving we obtain the optimal scaling as

\end{equation*}
\]</span> --></p>

<p class="center"><img src="docking/math_docking_eq22.png" /></p>

<p>Inserting the optimal <i>a</i> into the function to minimize, expanding and
simplifying we have squared error under optimal scaling and centering as

<!-- <span class="LaTeX">\[
\begin{equation*}
| F |^2 - |G|^{-2} \left[ \int F(x) \, G(x)\,dx \right] ^2 \\ |

\]</span> --></p>

<p class="center"><img src="docking/math_docking_eq26.png" /></p>

<p>In practice, many of the {<i>g<sub>i</sub></i>} will be the same since they
represent elements {C, N, O, S, ...}. Consequently, we represent these
integrals on a separate grid <i>S</i> per atom (i.e., per element)
<!-- <span class="LaTeX">\[

\]</span> --></p>

<p class="center"><img src="docking/math_docking_eq27.png" /></p>

<p>Note that these grids can be computed efficiently by convolution using FFT.
The correlation then becomes
<!-- <span class="LaTeX">\[

\end{equation*}
\]</span> --></p>

<p class="center"><img src="docking/math_docking_eq30.png" /></p>

<p>Most of the contribution to |<i>G</i>|<sup>2</sup> will come from the
{<i>g<sub>ii</sub></i>} and <i>g<sub>ij</sub></i> when <i>i</i> and <i>j</i>
are bonded. (Angles at standard geometries could be included as well.)
Consequently, we can use standard bond lengths (and angles) and neglect the
remaining overlaps and assume that |<i>G</i>| is constant. We arrive at

<p>where we have assumed that <span style=

<p class="center"><img src="docking/math_docking_eq34.png" /></p>

<p>where we can fold the |<i>F</i>|<sup>-1</sup> into the
{<i>S<sub>i</sub></i>}; i.e. assume that <i>F</i> is normalized. This latter
form has the advantage that <i>f</i> is near -|<i>G</i>| for an ideal fit and
positive when not and achieves a maximum of near |<i>G</i>|.</p>

<p>The electron density correlation, describing the match between <i>F</i> and
<i>G</i>, is integrated directly into the forcefield as an additional term:
<!-- <span class="LaTeX">\[
\begin{equation*}

\end{equation*}
\]</span> --></p>

<p class="center"><img src="docking/math_docking_eq35.png" /></p>

<p>where the outer sum is over distinct atomic elements in the ligand, and the
inner sum is over all atoms of that element, each at position
<i>r<sub>i</sub></i>. <i>&alpha;</i> is a scale factor set to 1. The scale
factor <i>F</i> accounts for the fact that we are only fitting ligand atoms and
not the whole unit cell, and is computed as: <!-- <span class="LaTeX">\[

{protons}_{\mathrm{asu}}}}
\end{equation}
\]</span> --></p>

<p class="center"><img src="docking/math_docking_eq36.png" /></p>

<p>where <i>n</i><sub>copies</sub> is the number of symmetry copies in the unit
cell and <i>n</i><sub>protons<sub>asu</sub></sub> is the total count of protons
in the asymmetric unit; thus the total electron density should integrate
(approximately) to <i>n</i><sub>copies</sub>*<i>n</i><sub>protons</sub>.
<i>F</i><sub>mag</sub> is the actual RMS integral of the density over the unit
cell, and <i>n</i><sub>protons</sub> is the number of protons in the ligand
being fit.  The forcefield gradient is computed accordingly as well.</p>

<p>Using the same definition of <i>S<sub>i</sub></i> from above, the electron
density score is defined as simply the sum of the <i>S<sub>i</sub></i> over
each distinct atomic element:
<!-- <span class="LaTeX">\[
\begin{equation*} \operatorname{score} =

\]</span> --></p>

<p class="center"><img src="docking/math_docking_eq37.png" /></p>

<p>where the outer sum is over distinct atomic elements in the ligand, and the
inner sum over all atoms of that element, each at position
<i>r<sub>i</sub></i>.</p>

<a id="Duplication_Removal">
<h2>Duplicate Removal</h2>
</a>

<p>Duplicate removal is not performed using a conventional RMSD cutoff
approach. Instead, the hydrogen bonding pattern and hydrophobic interaction
pattern between the ligand and the receptor are considered. A pair of
ligand-receptor atoms of the appropriate types are considered to have a
hydrogen bond interaction if they are less than 3.5&Aring; apart. A hydrophobic
atom on the ligand is considered to have a hydrophobic interaction with a
receptor residue if that atom is under 4.5&Aring; away from a hydrophobic atom
of that residue. Poses are considered as duplicates if the same set of
ligand-receptor atom pairs are involved in hydrogen bond interactions and the
same set of ligand atom receptor residue pairs are involved in hydrophobic
interactions.</p>

<a id="Protein_Method">
<h2>Protein-Protein Docking</h2>
</a>

<p>In protein-protein docking one protein structure, referred to as the
<i>ligand</i>, is docked against another, referred to as the <i>receptor</i>.
Commonly, the smaller structure is chosen to be the ligand, but there is no
requirement that it be so.  The calculation will be carried out by aligning
each protein in a standard orientation and using as the fixed grid whichever
is larger.  Note that even though the proteins are aligned at the start of
the calculation the initial coordinates can still generate some randomness
due to rounding error in discretizing the grids.  The initial choice of
receptor and ligand will determine the reference frame of the output poses
as well as which protein defines the point of view of the PLIF calculation,
if applicable.  For example, to carry out epitope analysis the antigen
would be considered the receptor, regardless of size.</p>

<p>The protein-protein docker uses a multi-stage method for generating poses
and then ranking them. Starting from a coarse-grained (CG) model to reduce the
computational search space, exhaustive sampling is carried out to generate a
set of initial poses.  The Hopf fibration is used to generate a set of
uniformly-distributed rotations [Yershova] and a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
is used to sample all translations for a given rotation.  This is followed by a
minimization process that is built around a staged convergence protocol.</p>

<p>Protein-protein docking proceeds according to the following steps:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
  <li>Create a residue-based CG rigid-body representation of the structures
  to be docked.</li>
  <li>Create a grid-based representation of receptor fields.</li>

  default target RMSD of <span class="nobr">3.5 &Aring;</span>.
  Keep only those rotations which correspond to smaller angles than any

  <li>Loop over rotations:

      <li>Generate a complementary grid of coefficients for ligand.</li>
      <li>Calculate the FFT of the rotated ligand grid as well as all
      of its symmetry operations by permuting the indices.</li>
      <li>Calculate the grid-based protein interaction energy for all
      translations using FFT convolutions.</li>
      <li>Record the top two translations for each rotation and top two
      rotations for each translation.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Fast minimize unique poses as CG rigid-bodies using a
  (1+<i>r</i>)<sup>-2</sup> form for electrostatics.</li>
  <li>Further minimize the <i>N<sub>top</sub></i> (default 10<sup>3</sup>)
  poses accounting for solvation free-energy using GBVI.</li>
  <li>Rank according to the interaction energy.</li>

<h4>Coarse-Grained (CG) Representation</h4>

<p>The proteins are first rendered into a coarse-grained (CG) residue-based
representation in which each residue is composed of one to three
&quot;united-atom&quot; beads following the scheme proposed by Basdevant <i>et
al.</i> [Basdevant]</p>

<p class="center"><img src="docking/figure1_ppdock_docu.jpg" alt= "Examples of
coarse-grained residues and protein." /></p>

<p class="caption">a) Coarse-grained Glycine, Lysine, and Arginine; b)
Coarse-grained <i>&alpha;</i>&ndash;amylase</p>

<p>The CG representation includes the following energy components: van der
Waals, electrostatic, and solvation <i>via</i> the Generalized Born Volume
Integral (GB/VI) formalism [Labute].</p>

<p><b>CG van der Waals Interactions</b></p>

<p>The united-atom beads making up the residues interact via a van der Waals
(vdW) potential that has been calibrated to reproduce all-atom (AA) derived
energies using just a few parameters, namely sizes <i>&sigma;<sub>i</sub></i>
and <i>&lambda;<sub>i</sub></i> along with energy scale
<i>&epsilon;<sub>i</sub></i>, defined for each residue <i>i</i> [Basdevant].
The Lorentz-Berthelot rule is used for mixing the coefficients of interacting
beads <i>i</i> and <i>j</i> separated by a distance <i>r<sub>i</sub></i> such
that <span class=
"nobr"><i>&sigma;<sub>ij</sub></i>=(<i>&sigma;<sub>i</sub></i> +
<i>&sigma;<sub>j</sub></i>)/2</span>, <span class=
"nobr"><i>&lambda;<sub>ij</sub></i>=(<i>&lambda;<sub>i</sub></i> +
<i>&lambda;<sub>j</sub></i>)/2</span>, and
<i>&epsilon;<sub>ij</sub>=(&epsilon;<sub>i</sub>&epsilon;<sub>j</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup></i>.
This gives:

<!-- <span class="LaTeX">\[
\begin{equation}
U_{\mathrm{vdW}}(r_{ij}) = \epsilon_{ij} \left[ \left(
\frac{\lambda_{ij}}{r_{ij}} \right)^6 -\exp \left( -\left( \frac{r_{ij}}
{\sigma_{ij}} \right)^2 \right) \right]
\end{equation}
\]</span> --></p>

<p class="center"><img src="docking/math_docking_eq4.png" /></p>
  <!-- &#771; is the tilde diacritical mark -->

<p>The van der Waals potential defined this way exhibits a minimum
<i>E</i><sub>min,<i>ij</i></sub> at a distance
<i>r</i><sub>min,<i>ij</i></sub>. An approximation
<i>U&#771;<sub>vdW</sub>(r<sub>ij</sub>)</i> to the above vdW potential can be
calculated using an 8,6 Lennard-Jones formulation:

<!-- <span class="LaTeX">\[
\begin{equation}
\tilde U_{\mathrm{vdW}}(r_{ij}) = E_{\mathrm{min},ij} \left[ 3\left(
\frac{r_{\mathrm{min},ij}}{r_{ij}} \right)^8 - 4\left(
\frac{r_{\mathrm{min},ij}}{r_{ij}} \right)^6 \right]
\end{equation}
\]</span> --></p>

<p class="center"><img src="docking/math_docking_eq5.png" /></p>

<p>This faster to compute formulation of the vdW energy is the one used in the
Protein-Protein Docker.</p>

<p><b>CG Electrostatic Interactions</b></p>

<p>For a given CG protein, beads charges are determined by minimizing the
difference between the electrostatic field produced by these point charges and
the one calculated for the AA protein in vacuum using AMBER 10 parameters as
suggested by Basdevant <i>et al</i>. [Basdevant] For two point charges
<i>Q<sub>i</sub></i> and <i>Q<sub>j</sub></i> separated by a distance
<i>r<sub>ij</sub></i>, we have used the following general form of the Coulomb
energy:

<p>where <i>b</i> plays the role of a buffer and <i>n</i> is a tunable
exponent. When the output of the FFT docking phase is first minimized,
<i>b</i>=1 and <i>n</i>=2. This leads to an electrostatic potential more
permissive of slight overlaps (clashes). When the final minimization occurs,
bare electrostatic interactions defined by <i>b</i>=0 and <i>n</i>=1 are paired
with solvation free-energies described below.</p>

<p><b>CG Solvation Free-Energies</b></p>

<p>Solvation effects are implicitly accounted for using the Generalized Born
Volume Integral (GBVI) approach as detailed in [Labute]. Whereas the van der
Waals and electrostatic interactions are computed for pairs of beads belonging
to the two proteins to be docked, the GBVI derived interactions include both
self and cross contributions to properly account for disturbances in the
electrostatic field and in the solvent shells surrounding the proteins as they
approach one another.</p>

<h4>CG Grid Representations</h4>

<p>Once the proteins involved in the docking procedure have been
coarse-grained, they are cast onto three dimensional grids to allow for quick
exploration of the configuration space using FFTs. The FFT approach effectively
allows for calculating the translational energy landscape in a single pass for
each mutual orientation to be sampled. The grids have cells of isotropic side
lengths <i>&Delta;s</i>.</p>

<p><b>Receptor</b></p>

<p>The fields surrounding a set of CG beads <i>j</i> that constitute the
<b>receptor</b> are calculated on a grid with a default grid spacing of <span
class="nobr">3.5 &Aring;</span>. For each grid point <i>k</i>:

  <!-- <span class="LaTeX">\[
\begin{equation}
\varphi_{\mathrm{rep},k} = \sum_j3A_jr_{k,j}^{-8}:~A_j =
\sqrt{E_{\mathrm{min},j}}r_{\mathrm{min},j}^4,
\end{equation}
\]</span> --></p>

<p class="center"><img src="docking/math_docking_eq7.png" /></p>
  <!-- <span class="LaTeX">\[
\begin{equation}
\varphi_{\mathrm{att},k} = -\sum_j4B_jr_{k,j}^{-6}:~B_j =
\sqrt{E_{\mathrm{min},j}}r_{\mathrm{min},j}^3,
\end{equation}
\]</span> -->

<p class="center"><img src="docking/math_docking_eq8.png" /></p>
  <!-- <span class="LaTeX">\[
\begin{equation}
\varphi_{\mathrm{ele},k} = \varphi_{\mathrm{PBE},k}(\vec Q_j),
\end{equation}
\]</span> -->

<p class="center"><img src="docking/math_docking_eq9.png" /></p>

<p>where <i>&phi;<sub>rep,k</sub></i> and <i>&phi;<sub>att,k</sub></i> are the
repulsive and attractive van der Waals &quot;fields&quot;, while
<i>&phi;<sub>ele,k</sub></i> is the electrostatic field as given by the
solution to the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equations (PBE) for a set of
charges <i>Q<sub>j</sub></i>. The values <i>A<sub>j</sub></i> and
<i>B<sub>j</sub></i> are essentially combining <i>E</i><sub>min,<i>ij</i></sub>
and <i>r</i><sub>min,<i>ij</i></sub> for the self-interactions of beads
<i>j</i>.</p>

<p><b>Ligand</b></p>

<p>The CG beads comprising the <b>ligand</b> are cast onto a complementary grid
of coefficients such that, for each point <i>k</i>, a weighted Gaussian
integrated bead density resulting from neighboring beads <i>i</i> can be
calculated:
<!-- <span class="LaTeX">\[
\begin{equation}
\rho_{\mathrm{rep},k} = \sum_iA_if_G(\vec r_k, \vec r_i):~A_i =
\sqrt{E_{\mathrm{min},i}}r_{\mathrm{min},i}^4,
\end{equation}
\]</span> --></p>

<p class="center"><img src="docking/math_docking_eq10.png" /></p>
  <!-- <span class="LaTeX">\[
\begin{equation}
\rho_{\mathrm{att},k} = \sum_iB_if_G(\vec r_k, \vec r_i):~A_i =

\end{equation}
\]</span> -->

<p class="center"><img src="docking/math_docking_eq11.png" /></p>
  <!-- <span class="LaTeX">\[
\begin{equation}
\rho_{\mathrm{ele},k} = \sum_iQ_if_G(\vec r_k, \vec r_i),
\end{equation}
\]</span> -->

<p class="center"><img src="docking/math_docking_eq12.png" /></p>

<p>where the function
<i>f<sub>G</sub>(r<sub>k</sub>,r<sub>i</sub>,&sigma;<sub>i</sub>)</i> defines
the Gaussian integral value of bead <i>i</i> of extent
<i>&sigma;<sub>i</sub></i> at grid point <i>k</i>:

<!-- <span class="LaTeX">\[
\begin{equation}
f_G(\vec r_k, \vec r_i) = \int_{\vec r_k - \Delta s/2}^
{\vec r_k + \Delta s/2} \left(2\pi\sigma^2\right)^{-3/2}
\exp\left(\frac{\left|\vec r - \vec r_i\right|^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)d^3r,
\end{equation}
\]</span> --></p>

<p class="center"><img src="docking/math_docking_eq13.png" /></p>

<p><b>Grid Energies <i>via</i> Convolutions</b></p>

<p>Given a grid of field values <i>&phi;</i> surrounding a receptor and
complementary coefficients <i>&rho;(</i>R,<i><b>T</b>)</i> representing an
interacting ligand rotated by R and translated by <i><b>T</b></i> away from an
initial configuration, we can calculate the energy of interaction to be:

<!-- <span class="LaTeX">\[
\begin{equation}
U = \sum_k\rho_k\phi_k,
\end{equation}
\]</span> --></p>

<p class="center"><img src="docking/math_docking_eq14.png" /></p>

<p>the result of a sum running over all <i>k</i> grid points. The above is a
<i>convolution</i> of <i>&rho;</i> and <i>&phi;</i>, which can be calculated
efficiently using FFTs:

<!-- <span class="LaTeX">\[
\begin{equation}
U(\{\vec T\}) = \mathrm{FFT}^{-1}(\mathrm{FFT}(\rho(\mathrm{R},0)) \times
\mathrm{FFT}(\phi)),
\end{equation}
\]</span> --></p>

<p class="center"><img src="docking/math_docking_eq15.png" /></p>

<p>where the FFT of the coefficient values <i>&rho;</i> is taken with respect
to the reference position, say at <i><b>T</b></i>=0. The above equation yields
the value of U simultaneously for <i>all</i> translations {<i><b>T</b></i>}
allowed by the size of the grids, and not just for the desired translation
<i><b>T</b></i>. Hence, it provides a quick way to explore the energy landscape
in translational space.</p>

<h4>Site Restraints and Hydrophobic Patch Potential</h4>

<p>In addition to the standard grids and potential functions described above,
optional terms can be added corresponding to site restraints and to a non-local
hydrophobic solvation energy derived from <a href=
"../proteins/propatch.htm">protein patch analysis</a>. These terms take the
form:</p>

<!-- <span class="LaTeX">\[
E_{\mathrm{site}} = 1-\delta\left(\sum_{i\in \mathrm{site}}~\sum_{j\notin \mathrm{mol}_i}
f(r_{ij})\right),
\]</span> -->

<p class="center"><img src="docking/math_docking_eqSite.png" /></p>
<!-- <span class="LaTeX">\[
E_{\mathrm{patch}} = \sum_{i\in \mathrm{mol}_1}A_i\prod_{jin \mathrm{mol}_2}
\left(1-f(r_{ij})\right),
\]</span> -->

<p class="center"><img src="docking/math_docking_eqPatchA.png" /></p>

<p>where <!-- <span class="LaTeX">\[
f(r_{ij}) = \int_{\vec r_j-r_{cut}}^{\vec r_j+r_{cut}}f_G(\vec r_i, \vec r)d^3r
\]</span> --></p>

<p class="center"><img src="docking/math_docking_eqPatchB.png" /></p>

<p>and <em>r<sub>cut</sub></em> = 5.0 &Aring;.</p>

<p>In the case of site restraints this corresponds to a large penalty unless at
least one site bead interacts with the other protein, and in the case of the
patch potential it is proportional to the total area (<em>A<sub>i</sub></em>)
of solvent-exposed hydrophobic beads.</p>


<a id="Running_Dock">
<h1>Running Dock</h1>
</a>

<p>A docking study typically proceeds according to the following workflow:</p>

<ol>
  <li> <b>Prepare the Receptor and the Ligand.</b> For good results, the raw
  crystallographic structure must be properly <a href=
  "#Preparing_the_Receptor">prepared</a>, e.g. usually hydrogens must be added,
  structural problems, if any, addressed, partial charges calculated, and some
  geometry optimization performed. The ligand is obtained either from a file or
  a database or by creating it using the <a
  href="../moe/molsystems/build.htm">Molecule Builder</a>.  </li>

  <li><b>Set up the Dock Protocol.</b> In the Dock panel, the receptor, binding
  site, and ligand must be specified. An optional pharmacophore filter may also
  be specified. Specialized dock protocols exist for particular scenarios, such
  as covalent or protein-protein docking, but by default, the Dock panel opens
  onto the <b>General</b> docking page. This page offers the flexibility of
  defining a variety of protocols by allowing the placement method, scoring
  function(s) and refinement options to be set individually. For example, in
  addition to a conventional rigid receptor docking protocol, flexible receptor
  docking can be achieved by specifying <b>Induced Fit</b> as the
  <b>Refinement</b> method. Similarly, a virtual screening run can be set up by
  disabling refinement completely (choose <b>None</b>), whereas pose rescoring
  can be accomplished by setting <b>Placement</b> to <b>None</b>.</li>

  <li> <b>Run the Docking Simulation.</b> The Dock calculations can be run as
  a foreground process, in which case their progress can be monitored in the <a
  href="../moe/gui/svlcommands.htm">SVL Commands</a> window; the output is
  written to a <a href="../mdb/db.htm">MOE database</a> and can be examined
  while the simulation is on-going.  The calculation can be stopped from the
  Dock GUI by pressing <b>Stop</b>. (Note that the <a
  href="../moe/gui/mainwin.htm#Cancel">Cancel</a> menu can always be used to
  cancel tasks.)  Calculations can also be run as batch jobs.
  </li>

  <li> <b>Analyze the Results.</b> The output scores, ligand strain energies,
  and docked poses can be analyzed using a <a href=
  "../mdb/dbbrowse.htm">Database Browser</a>.  </li>
</ol>

<p>The Dock application has been arranged in a series of stages, as described
in the <a href="#Methodology_Overview">Methodology</a> section above. Each of
these stages may be bypassed, if desired. As a result, the application can also
be used, as described above, to rescore or refine poses resulting from earlier
Dock runs or even from other docking applications. <b>Warning!</b> When the
docking application is used to rescore or refine poses from earlier Dock runs,
the receptor conformation resulting from the previous run will <i>not</i> be
taken into account; Dock always uses the receptor, as defined through the Dock
GUI, in the current molecular system.</p>

<a id="Preparing_the_Receptor">
<h2>Preparing the Receptor</h2>
</a>

<p>Dock requires a receptor structure, usually a protein, loaded in MOE. The
structure data is typically crystallographic data read from a <a href=
"../proteins/pdb_mdb.htm#OpeningPDBFiles">PDB file</a>, obtained from the MOE
<a href="../proteins/pdb_mdb.htm#MOEPDB">protein database</a> or directly from
the <a href="../moe/gui/fileopen.htm#PSILODownload">PDB or PSILO</a>.  The data
might also be loaded from a <a href="../mdb/db.htm">MOE database</a> or pasted
from the <a href="../moe/gui/mainwin.htm#Copy">clipboard</a>.</p>

<p>Structural data often contains errors. Additional preparatory steps are
commonly required, such as capping, completing residues with missing atoms, and
selecting appropriate alternate locations. In MOE, structural issues can be
automatically corrected using the Structure Preparation application (<span
class="menu">MOE | Compute | Prepare | Structure Preparation</span>).  Once the
panel is raised, press <b>Correct</b>. This will result in an attempt to
correct all issues detected the application. For more information on manual
preparation, please see the chapter on using the <a href=
"../apps/structprep.htm">Structure Preparation</a> application.</p>

<p>Although not required by the default docking methods, it may be desirable to
optimize the hydrogen bond network (<span class="menu">MOE | Compute | Prepare
| <a href="protonate3d.htm">Protonate&nbsp;3D</a></span>) and calculate charges
(<span class="menu">MOE | Compute | Prepare | <a href=
"../moe/pot.htm#Charges">Partial&nbsp;Charges</a></span>) as optimal hydrogen
positions and charges are necessary if any molecular mechanics refinement is to
be performed on the docked poses. If this is desired, the molecular mechanics
<a href="../moe/pot.htm">forcefield and solvation model</a> should be
selected.</p>

<p>It may also be desirable to perform tethered energy minimization prior to
commencement of docking to relieve bad crystallographic contacts or other bad
geometries. Note that in this case, the <a href="../apps/emin.htm">Energy
Minimize</a> application itself can be used to adjust hydrogens and lone pairs
and to calculate partial charges. Tethering, which prevents receptor atoms from
deviating too far from their initial coordinates, can be done through the
Energy Minimize panel. Alternatively, the <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | <a
href="../apps/ligx.htm#Prepare">QuickPrep</a></span> panel can be used to add
tether restraints to receptor, ligand, and/or solvent atoms (<b>Receptor</b>,
<b>Ligand</b>, <b>Solvent</b>) and then perform energy minimization on the
system (enable <b>Refine</b>).</p>

<p>An additional step that may be taken is to delete extraneous co-factors or
unbound water molecules. Water molecules which play structural roles within the
protein (such as bridging waters) and important cofactors should be retained
for the docking simulation.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Exceptionally, for protein-protein docking, it is necessary to
remove all small molecules (ligands, solvent, excipients &mdash; all
non-protein entities).</p>

<p>Finally, the <a href="progeom.htm">Protein Geometry</a> application can be
used to assess the stereochemical quality of the protein.</p>

<ul class="help">
  <li class="help" style="padding-left: 25px;">For more information on
  receptor preparation, please see the chapter on <a href=
  "../apps/structprep.htm">Structure Preparation</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<a id="Identifying_the_Binding_Site">
<h2>Identifying the Binding Site</h2>
</a>

<p>In conventional small molecule docking, the binding pocket of the receptor
must be specified (this is optional for protein-protein and covalent docking,
in which case specifying the binding site is used to focus the search space).
This can be done in a number of ways, typically one of:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Specifying the atoms of a co-crystallized ligand and any other small
  molecules that are present in the pocket (the latter will be ignored during
  docking).</li>
  <li>Specifying the residues of a pocket.</li>
  <li>Selecting the site points (alpha sphere &quot;dummy&quot; atoms) created
  by MOE's <a href="sitefind.htm">Site Finder</a> application.  </li>
</ol>

<p>(<b>Hint:</b> <a href="../moe/gui/select.htm#NamedSets">Named sets</a> may
be used to facilitate the marking of atoms / residues / site point
dummies.)</p>

<p>The Dock application can also automatically detect the site from proximity
to the ligand atoms or from the pocket atoms, as detected by <span class=
"menu">MOE | Select | <a href=
"../moe/gui/mainwin.htm#Pocket">Pocket</a></span>.</p>

<p>For all placement methods except protein-protein, covalent, and external
dockers, alpha spheres within 5&nbsp;&Aring; of any atoms / residues / site
points selected to define the docking site will be generated for use in the
placement method.</p>

<p>It is recommended that the docking site be a subset (rather than all) of the
receptor. Otherwise, Dock will also try to dock the ligand to areas
&quot;outside&quot; of the receptor.</p>

<a id="Preparing_the_Ligand">
<h2>Ligand Specification</h2>
</a>

<p>Dock requires the specification of a ligand to dock. This can be a single
molecule in MOE or it can be a collection of ligands in one or more <a href=
"../mdb/db.htm">MOE databases</a>. If a conformational search
has already been carried out (e.g. with <a href="confgui.htm">High Throughput
Conformational Analysis</a>), the database will contain a set of conformations
for each ligand.</p>

<ul class="help">
  <li class="help" style="padding-left: 25px;">For more information on
  preparing 3D structures, please see <a href="../moe/prep3ddb.htm">Preparing
  a 3D Structure Database</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Note:</b> If the docked poses are to be refined, the MOE Window will show
an image of the ligand (and also the receptor pocket, if it is flexible) being
refined. However, the display is provided for visual purposes only. The actual
refinement is carried out in a separate calculation that is independent of the
display. It is permissible to continue working in the MOE Window as any
operations performed will not affect the refinement calculation. If a change in
molecular topology is detected, the refinement display will simply terminate,
leaving the refinement process to continue undisturbed in the background.</p>

<i>MOE Dock Panel</i></p>

<p>The Dock panel is divided into four main sections. The system (receptor,
active site, and ligand) along with any constraints is specified at the top.
Options for the final scoring and output are specified in the bottom section of
the panel. These two sections are common to all placement methods and remain
static regardless of which placement method is selected. The left-hand side of
the panel contains six buttons that allow for the selection of various
placement methods available in MOE. When one of the placement methods is

          is placed using the features in the pharmacophore. Volume constraints
          are applied as a final filter but are ignored during the placement
          stage. If there are more than two pharmacophore features and they do
          not lie on or close to a straight line, the pharmacophore search
          engine is used to orient the ligand. If the pharmacophore features
          lie on or very close to a line, the ligand is anchored by the
          pharmacophore features and rotated such that a third atom matches an
          alpha site point. If all pharmacophore features lie at a point or
          very close to one point, the ligand is first anchored at that point.
          Then, two more atoms on the ligand are matched to two alpha site
          points to orient the ligand. Since the ligand pose changes upon
          refinement, if there is a refinement stage, the pharmacophore
          constraints are loosened for placement.  Furthermore, if a

<p> As Covalent Docking creates a connection between the protein and ligand, it
uses a more complex placement process:

  <ol>
    <li>Identify the pocket residues - these will be treated as component
    #1 of the reaction.  The ligand will be treated as component #2.</li>

    <li>Perform the reaction, yielding one or more products.  Note that
    multiple connection sites are possible, based on the
    <span class="nobr"><b>Reactive Site</b></span> setting.</li>

    <li>For each product, create an <i>alignment stub</i> using all of the
    heavy atoms in the pocket that are numbered in both the reactants and
    the products.  Hydrogens are included if necessary as the
    stub must have at least three atoms.  This stub is used to align the ligand
    when constructing the complex, and is discarded when the protein-ligand
    connection is made.</li>

    <li>Mark the atoms proximate to the protein-ligand connection.  These
    must be ignored when scoring the complex so that they are not seen as
    repulsive interactions.</li>

    <li>Use Conformation Import to create the unique lower-energy ring and
    chiral classes for the stub-ligand.  Each of these will be used as starting
    points for rotamer generating using <b>Rotate Bonds</b>.</li>

    <li>Place each rotamer in the pocket by aligning on the stub and then
    performing
    small rotations and translations about the center of mass to
    determine the lowest-scoring placement (using Dock's
    <a href="#Alpha_HB_Scoring">Alpha Score</a>).</li>
  </ol>

<br />

<p>
<b>Note:</b> The placement process described above is performed for every input
structure.  Reactions are provided as 2D sketches which must yield 3D
structures suitable for placement.  Thus, for Covalent Docking, it is
recommended to use a non-conformer database as input. </p>

    be obtained from <a href= "http://www.biosolveit.de">BioSolveIT</a>. Flex*
    must be installed and configured, and then information about the location
    of the appropriate files must be provided to the MOE docking framework (see
    below). From that point onward, Flex* becomes operationally equivalent to
    one of the built-in MOE placement methods.</p>

    <p>To use and/or configure Flex* within MOE, set the <b>Placement</b>

    <td><b>Refinement</b></td>
    <td> The structures generated by the placement method can be further
    refined by selecting <b>Induced Fit</b> or <b>Rigid Receptor</b> from the
    option menu, or, in the case of Protein-Protein docking, <b>Rigid Body</b>.

    <p><b>Induced Fit</b> is appropriate when flexible protein sidechains are
    to be included in the refinement stage. <b>Rigid Body</b> will repack
    sidechains using a rotamer library prior to carrying out a rigid-body
    minimization.</p>

    <p>Energy minimization of the system is carried out using a conventional
    molecular mechanics setup. The current prevailing <a href=
    "../moe/pot.htm">molecular mechanics forcefield</a> will be used.  <b>The
    charges of all atoms will be reassigned</b> under the current
    forcefield.</p>

    <p>Default settings can be changed using the Configure panel, which is
    opened by pressing the <img src="docking/gear_icon.png" alt= "Configure
    Gear" style="vertical-align: middle" /> button. <span class=
    "warning">Note:</span> Not all options appear for each refinement
    option.</p>

    <p class="center"><img src="docking/inducedfit_config.png" alt=
    "Configure Induced Fit Refinement" /></p>

    <p>In order to speed up the calculation, residues (or atoms, depending on
    the <b>Pocket</b> setting in the Configure panel) over a cutoff distance
    (<b>Cutoff</b> in the Configure panel, default is 6 &Aring;) away from all
    the pre-refined poses are ignored, both during the refinement and in the
    final energy evaluation. However, if after the refinement any poses are
    moved to within 80% of the cutoff distance of any ignored atoms, the
    refinement stage will be repeated with an increased cutoff distance.</p>

    <p>By default, backbone atoms are held fixed during refinement. When
    <b>Rigid Receptor</b> is chosen, sidechains of the receptor are also held
    fixed. In <b>Induced Fit</b> mode, sidechains can be tethered to their
    original positions (<b>Tether</b>, <b>B-Factor</b>, or <b>As-is
    (pocket)</b>), or are free to move (<b>Free</b>).</p>

    <p>When tethering is used, the parameters <i>L</i> and <i>U</i>, as
    described in the <a href="../moe/pot.htm#Restraints">manual page for
    tethering</a>, are both set to 0. The weights of the tethers <i>w</i> are
    either determined from the individual atom temperature factors (B-factors)
    or set to user-defined values. In the case of the <b>Tether</b> option, a
    single user-defined value is applied to all sidechain atoms. Tethering
    using B-factors has the following interpretation: an atom's root mean
    square deviation from its equilibrium position will be equal to the given
    B-factor if the atom is floating freely in the potential well of the tether
    at 300 K. In the case of <b>As-is (pocket)</b>, the user-defined inert,
    fixed, tethered, and restrained atoms of the receptor pocket are
    honored.</p>

    <p>For protein-protein docking the repacking of all sidechains in the
    interface region is turned on by default, but can be skipped by un-checking
    the <b>Repack From Library</b> option.</p>

    <p>By default, during the refinement, solvation effects are calculated
    using the <a href="../moe/pot.htm#Equation">reaction field functional
    form</a> for the electrostatic energy term and a dielectric constant of 4.
    However, if you prefer to use the current <a href=
    "../moe/fcnref/potfcn.htm">potential setup</a>, the default behavior can be
    disabled by toggling off the <tt>Potential Setup</tt> checkbox in the
    Configure panel.</p>

    <p>By default, the final energy is evaluated using the <a href=
    "../moe/pot.htm#Equation">Generalized Born solvation model (GB/VI)</a>.  If
    this default setting is disabled, the final energy will simply be
    calculated in the same way as during minimization instead of using the
    Generalized Born solvation model. Note that in any case, the final energy
    includes only the interaction energy between the receptor and the ligand.
    The self-energies of both the receptor and the ligand are excluded.</p>

    <p>For refinement options which treat the ligand as flexible by default the
    ligand can also be held fixed by checking the <b>Rigid Ligand</b> option.
    The <b>Planar Systems Are Rigid Bodies</b> option can be used to treat all
    pi systems (connected components consisting of atoms connected with bonds
    of high pi bond order) as rigid bodies.</p>

    <p>In the presence of a pharmacophore defined using the <a href=
    "ph4_annot.htm">Unified Annotation Scheme</a>, restraints will be set up
    between the features on the ligand and the corresponding pharmacophore
    query points. If the distance between the feature and the query point
    exceeds a certain threshold (see below) by an amount <tt>x</tt>, there will
    be a penalty in the potential of the form <tt>kx<sup>3</sup></tt>. The
    threshold is the radius associated with the pharmacophore query point minus
    the <tt>Radius Offset</tt> parameter on the Configure panel, or zero if
    this results in a negative value. Both the force constant <tt>k</tt> and
    the <tt>Radius Offset</tt> are adjustable on the Configure panel. Their
    default values are 100.0 <nobr>kcal / (mol &Aring;<sup>3</sup>)</nobr> and
    0.4 &Aring;, respectively.</p>

<h2>Browsing the Output Database</h2>
</a>

<p>Output poses can be conveniently browsed using the <a href=
"../mdb/dbbrowse.htm">Database Browser</a>.  For docking results,
a custom browsing mode (<b>Subject:</b> <span class="nobr">
<tt>mol+receptor</tt></span>) is available which shows both
the ligand and the pocket simultaneously in the MOE Window and a 2D depiction
of the ligand as well as the docking score in the browse window.
In the case of rigid refinement (where the receptor is the same for
all poses) the Subject will be <tt>mol+(receptor)</tt> by default in
which the receptor is retrieved from the enviroment using <b>Rec_index</b>,
however the <b>Pocket: Enable</b> option will be unchecked by default
so that the receptor will not be shown.  See
<a href="../mdb/dbbrowse.htm#Docking_Database">Docking/Ligand-Pocket Browser</a>
for details.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="docking/dbbrowse.png" /></p>

<a id="Parallel_Docking_with_MOE/smp">
<h1>Parallel Docking with MOE/smp</h1>
</a>

<p>If the current instance of MOE is running in MPU mode, the
internally-implemented docking methods are automatically distributed to each
node of the cluster.</p>

<p>Because of the initialization time required to send a receptor across a
distributed system and analyze its properties, the MPU overhead is amortized by
dividing the input ligands into chunks of size <tt>N</tt>. For each unit
operation, the protein and the accompanying conformations for <tt>N</tt>
ligands are packaged and sent to the next available node, and the corresponding
<tt>N</tt> sets of poses are returned and then written to the output database
when the calculation is complete. The value of <tt>N</tt> is currently set to
10.</p>

<p>Since the docking of each ligand is independent, except for the
initialization of the receptor, the speedup can be expected to be almost linear
for most hardware configurations.</p>

<p>Installing and running MOE in MPU mode is described in the <a href=
"../install/smp_inst.htm">MOE/smp manual</a>. If MOE is being run on a
multiprocessor workstation, this can be setup by adding a command line
parameter, e.g.:</p>

<pre>
    cmd% moe -mpu 2
</pre>

<p>The above syntax will run MOE with two MPU nodes, both on the same
workstation.</p>

<p>Note that externally implemented docking methods, such as Flex*, rely on
their own built-in parallel algorithms, and will not be executed from MOE on
multiple nodes.</p>

<a id="Parallel_Docking_with_HPC">
<h1>Parallel Docking on High Performance Clusters</h1>
</a>

<p>For High Performance Clusters (HPC), the docking job splits the input into
multiple independent docking runs. The number of <b>partitions</b> can be set in
the <a href="../moe/hpc.htm#BatchPanel">Batch</a> job submit panel.
For optimal efficiency, the input should be split into as many
files as the number of simultaneous docking runs.</p>

<p>It is possible to choose from the Batch panel
whether or not the input files
for the ligand and the receptor should be copied to the job directory. This
should be avoided when the files are large and will be available from the HPC
worker nodes.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="docking/dock_batchpanel.png" alt= "Batch Panel" /></p>

<p>A post-processing step is done after all the independent runs are finished
to merge the results into a single database.</p>

<a id="Protein-Protein_HPC">
<h2>Distributed Protein-Protein Docking</h2>
</a>

<p>For protein-protein docking an additional <b>Verbose Log File</b> checkbox
is available which turns on additional output for writing to the batch job's log
file.  This can help to monitor job progress for systems which may take a long
time, but care should be taken since the resulting files can be potentially
quite large.</p>

<p>In the case where "all-versus-all" docking is being performed between two
protein databases (e.g. of different homologs/models/conformations), setting
the number of partitions to the total number of pairs of proteins will allow
running all docking jobs independently.  Some additional options are provided
when running batch jobs to handle such situations.</p>

<h2>Example: Fab fragment of IgG Antibody docking to birch allergen Bet v 1</h2>
</a>

<div class="example">

  <p>As shown in the previous section, our docker performs quite well on most
  antibodies. We thus selected <i>1FSK</i>, a complex of the major birch
  allergen Bet v 1 and a Fab fragment of a monoclonal murine IgG antibody, as a
  protein-protein docking example.</p>

  <p><b>Load and prepare the system</b></p>

  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
    <li>Open the MOE file:<br />
    <span class="menu">MOE | File | Open |
    $MOE/sample/mol/1fsk.moe.gz</span></li>
    <li>Set force-field to Amber:EHT:<br />
    <b>MOE | Footer | Amber:EHT</b><br /></li>
    <li>Prepare the structure:<br />
    <b>MOE | RHS | QuickPrep</b><br />
    Use default options and click <b>OK</b>.</li>
    <li>Annotate the chains using antibody detection:<br />
    <span class="menu">SE | Annotate | Antibody | CCG</span> or<br />
    <span class="menu">MOE | Protein | Annotate | Antibody | CCG</span>.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><b>Dock the complex</b></p>

  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
    <li>
      Open the Dock panel, select the Protein-Protein mode, and set up run:<br
      /> <span class="menu">MOE | Compute | Dock | Protein-Protein</span> or<br
      /> <span class="menu">MOE | Protein | Protein-Protein Dock</span>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Make sure the <b>Receptor</b> is set to <b>Antigen</b> and its <b>Site</b> to
      <b>All Atoms</b>.</p>

      <p>Make sure the <b>Ligand</b> is set to <b>Antibody</b> and that the <b>Ligand Site</b>
      is set to <b>CDR_H3</b>.</p>

      <p>Make sure <b>Use Hydrophobic Patch Potential</b> is selected to add the
      automatic patch analysis.</p>

      <p>For this example, <b>Refinement</b> can be set to <b>None</b>.
      Since that will save a large number of poses the <b>Generate
      Fingerprints</b> option can also be unchecked.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Run the docking procedure by clicking <b>Run</b> at the bottom of the
    panel.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Once the docking run is finished, the user is shown the result MDB
  database with the top-ranked ligand (antibody) poses.</p>

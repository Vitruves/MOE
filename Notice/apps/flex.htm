<p>Flexible Alignment is an application for flexibly aligning small molecules
  [Labute&nbsp;2001]. The method accepts as input a collection of small
  molecules with 3D coordinates and computes a collection of alignments. Each
  alignment is given a score that quantifies the quality of the alignment in
  terms of both internal strain and overlap of molecular features
  [Chan&nbsp;2010].</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> The scoring scheme changed in the 2009 release. The pre-2009
  scoring scheme can be restored by copying the file
  <tt>$MOE/svl/calc.svl/flexalgn.svl</tt> and making a small modification to
  it: change the value of the constant <tt>OLD</tt> from 0 to 1.</p>

<pre class="code oneline">
const OLD = 1;      // set to 1 for the pre-2009 scheme
</pre>

<p>This line is near the top of the file. Save the modified file and load
  it:</p>

<pre class="code oneline">
svl&gt; load 'flexalgn.svl'

<p>The old scheme is now in effect.</p>

  parallel.</p>

<h1><a id="Introduction">Introduction</a></h1>

<p>Often, atomic-level details of the structures of pharmaceutically relevant
  receptors are not available. In such cases, 3D alignment (or superposition)
  of putative ligands can be used to deduce structural requirements for
  biological activity. For example, CoMFA [Cramer&nbsp;1988] also uses a 3D
  molecular alignment as input. Another strategy is pharmacophore elucidation
  in which several ligands are aligned and a small collection of essential
  molecular features required for biological activity is derived from the
  alignment (e.g. [Martin&nbsp;1993]). Still another strategy is to use 3D
  molecular alignment to search a database for ligands that have one or more
  conformations that superpose well with a query molecule (e.g.
  [Miller&nbsp;1999]). Methodologies based upon 3D alignment for finding
  biologically active ligands generally make use of the qualitative assumption
  that if two ligands have similar biological activity and bind in similar
  modes, then the bound conformations of the two ligands align well and
  inferences can be made about the nature of the receptor.</p>

<p>Methods for producing molecular alignments are generally judged according
  to a number of criteria:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Scoring. Given an experimental alignment of two ligands of similar
    activity that bind in the same mode, will the method score this alignment
    best (or near best) over all other alignments? This determines whether top
    scoring alignments can be used to make inferences about the nature of the
    receptor.</li>
    <li>Completeness. If a high-scoring molecular alignment exists will the
    method find it? This determines if a molecule can be rejected (e.g. judged
    inactive) if no alignment is produced.</li>
    <li>Running Time. What is the average running time per pair of molecules?
    This determines whether the method is suitable for database searching.</li>
  </ol>

<p>Flexible Alignment is a stochastic search procedure that simultaneously
  searches the conformation space of a collection of molecules and the space of
  alignments of those molecules (at a rate of a few tens of seconds per
  iteration). As a result, the method is asymptotically complete. The scoring
  of alignments is based upon a Gaussian density representation of features
  tuned to reproduce certain X-ray crystallographic alignments, although it
  must be remembered that experimental and modeling errors must be taken into
  account when making any assessment of scoring function quality (and the
  degree to which bound conformations can be calculated by 3D molecular
  alignment).</p>

<h1><a id="Methodology">Methodology</a></h1>
  <!-- Comment from flexalgn.svl:
// Each molecule is described by a sum of gaussian representations where
// each atom is a gaussian of the form:
//
//      Pi * (Si / 2PI)**(3/2) exp {-0.5 * Si * (x - Xi)'(x - Xi)}
//
// where Si = (2/aRi)**2, Ri is the radius of atom i, Xi is the position
// of atom i, a is a radius scale factor, and Pi is a property value.
//
// The overlap between two such gaussians is a gaussian of the form
//
//      Pi * Pj * (Sij/2PI)**(3/2) * exp {-0.5 * Sij * (Xi-Xj)'(Xi-Xj)
//
// where Sij = 4 / (Ri**2 + Rj**2).  The function Pi * Pj is regarded as
// a similarity measure. Hence, the similarity measure is defined to be
//
//      Wij * exp {Sij * (Xi-Xj)'(Xi-Xj)}               (Sij < 0)
//
// Different properties can be added by turning Wij into a sum of different
// similarity values.  In the calculations to follow, the dissimilarity
// is actually used instead of the similarity
-->

<p>The probability density functions used in Flexible Alignment are
  Gaussians. A <tt>Normal</tt>, or <tt>isotropic</tt> (spherically symmetric),
  Gaussian probability density has the functional form:
  <!-- <span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
f\left( x \right) = s^{3} \left( 2 \pi \right)^{-\frac{3}{2}}
    \exp \left( - \frac{1}{2} \left| x - x_{0} \right|^{2} s^{2} \right)
\end{align}
</span> --></p>

<img src="flex/math_flex_eq0.png" class="center" />

<p>where <i>s</i><sup>2</sup> is the inverse variance along each axis and
  <i>x</i><sub>0</sub> is the center (and mean) of the density. An atom with a
  nucleus located at <i>x</i><sub>0</sub> with van der Waals radius <i>r</i> is
  represented by: <!-- <span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
\left( a / r \right)^{3} \left( 2 \pi \right)^{-\frac{3}{2}}
    \exp \left( - \frac{1}{2} \left| x - x_{0} \right|^{2} \left( a/r \right)^{2} \right)
\end{align}
</span> --></p>

<img src="flex/math_flex_eq1.png" class="center" />

<p>where <i>a</i> determines how broad the density will be. For example, if
  <i>a</i> = 2 then approximately 90% of the density will be contained within
  one van der Waals radius of <i>x</i><sub>0</sub>. In general, the value of
  <i>a</i> can be used to approximate molecular volumes, i.e. to fill in the
  gaps between atoms.</p>

<p>Let {<i>x</i><sub>1</sub>,,x_{n}\) denote the 3D positions of <i>n</i>
  atoms of a molecule in a given conformation. Let the non-negative
  <i>w<sub>i</sub></i> denote the degree to which atom <i>i</i> has some
  property <i>P</i> (e.g. &quot;is aromatic&quot; or &quot;is donor&quot;). We
  assign to each point in space <i>x</i> the likelihood, expressed as a
  sum-of-Gaussians density, that <i>x</i> has that property:
  <!-- <span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
f_{p} \left( x \right) =
    \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{w_{i}}{W}
    \left( \frac{1}{2 \pi} \frac{a^{2}}{r_{i}^{2}} \right)^{\frac{3}{2}}
    \exp \left( - \frac{a^{2}}{2} \frac{\left| x - x_{i} \right|^{2}}{r_{i}^{2}} \right)
\end{align}
</span> --></p>

<img src="flex/math_flex_eq2.png" class="center" />

<p>This density is called the <i>P</i>-<i>density</i> of the conformation.
  For example, if <i>P</i> is the property &quot;is aromatic&quot; so that
  <i>w<sub>i</sub></i> is 1 when atom <i>i</i> is aromatic and 0 otherwise,
  then the function <i>f</i> is the <i>aromatic density</i> of the conformation
  and represents the likelihood that a given point in space is (in some sense)
  aromatic.</p>

<p>Given two <i>P</i>-densities for two given molecules or configurations,
  the <i>overlap</i> of the two densities is, itself, a sum-of-Gaussians
  density in the interatomic distances: <!-- <span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
\sum_{i=1}^{n}
\sum_{j=1}^{m}
    \frac{w_{i}}{W}
    \frac{v_{j}}{V}
    \left( \frac{a^{2}}{ 2 \pi \left( r_{i}^{2} + s_{j}^{2} \right) } \right)^{\frac{3}{2}}
    \exp \left( - \frac{a^{2}}{2} \frac{\left| x_{i} - y_{j} \right|^{2}}{r_{i}^{2} + s_{j}^{2}} \right)
\end{align}
</span> --></p>

<img src="flex/math_flex_eq3.png" class="center" />

<p>The <i>w<sub>i</sub></i> encode the features of the molecule. This overlap
  formulation generalizes to more than one property, or feature, through a
  weighted summation of the individual overlap equations. For example, given
  three properties defined by atomic property weights, <i>u</i>, <i>v</i>,
  <i>w</i>, we define the similarity of two molecular conformations to be
  <!-- <span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
F =
\sum_{i=1}^{n}
\sum_{j=1}^{n'}
    \frac{ C_{u} u_{i} u_{j}' + C_{v} v_{i} v_{j}' + C_{w} w_{i} w_{j}'}{n n'}
    \times
    \left(
        \frac{a^{2}}{ 2 \pi \left( r_{i}^{2} + r_{j}'^{2} \right) }
    \right)^{\frac{3}{2}}
    \exp \left(
        - \frac{a^{2}}{2} \frac{\left| x_{i} - x_{j}' \right|^{2}}{r_{i}^{2} + r_{j}'^{2}}
    \right)
\end{align}
</span> --></p>

<img src="flex/math_flex_eq4.png" class="center" />

<p>where <i>C<sub>u</sub></i>, <i>C<sub>v</sub></i> and <i>C<sub>w</sub></i>
  are positive weights intended to emphasize or de-emphasize particular
  <i>P</i>-densities. In this way, any number of features can be included into
  similarity calculation without additional computational complexity: the
  pair-wise weights need to be calculated only once.</p>

<p>This similarity measure, <i>F</i> also generalizes to more than two
  molecules through the averaging of all pair-wise similarities.</p>

<p>Flexible Alignment is able to combine a number of atomic properties into
  the similarity measure as <i>P</i>-densities:</p>
<table class="titlebar">

  <tr>

    <td><i>w<sub>i</sub></i> is 1 for each atom. This density models the

  </tr>
</table>

<p>The individual weights <i>w<sub>i</sub></i> in the above table are tunable
  parameters.</p>

<p>The projected pharmacophore terms work in the same way as the atom based
  terms. The same formulae are used, with the atomic positions substituted by
  the positions of the projected features. The features have the same
  definition as those in the <a href="ph4_annot.htm">Unified pharmacophore
  scheme</a>.</p>

<p>The default weights for the terms were obtained by training on about 30
  sets of aligned ligands in the PDB. Each of these sets must contain at least
  4 diverse ligands. The ligands are diverse in the sense that for any pair of
  ligands, the Tanimoto coefficient for the two MACSS keys is under 0.85. For
  all ligand pairs associated with one protein, one ligand (the template) is
  fixed and the other is flexibly aligned onto the template. Candidate aligned
  configurations were generated using only the volume overlap term. For each
  aligned configuration, a goodness measure is defined as 1 if the RMSD with
  the correct answer is under 1 &Aring; and 0 if the RMSD is over 3 &Aring;,
  and it drops off linearly for situations in between. Also the value of each
  feature term is calculated. Then, the weights associated with each feature
  term is determined one by one. At each stage, the weight of one term is under
  consideration. The correlation between the term in concern, the already
  decided terms, and the goodness function is used to determine the weight.</p>

<p>We are now working on a systematic protocol to obtain the default weights
  from the most recent PDB. These weights may hence change in the next
  release.</p>

<p>Alignments are &quot;sampled&quot; using a RIPS-style (Random Incremental
  Pulse Search) procedure [Raber&nbsp;1989] that incorporates the quantitative
  measure of goodness of an alignment defined above into the optimization
  stage:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>[Perturb] Generate a conformation for each molecule by randomly
    rotating bonds and inverting unconstrained chiral centers. Perform a
    rigid-body optimization of the similarity function.</li>
    <li>[Optimize] Minimize the grand alignment score <i>S</i> <!--
-<I>kT</I>&nbsp;log&nbsp;<I>F</I>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<I>U</I>
-->
     with respect to the coordinates of all of the atoms. <i>S</i> is simply a
    combination of the similarity measure (see above), and the average strain
    energy of the molecules (<i>U</i>).</li>
    <li>[Compare] If the new configuration has not been seen before (RMSD
    greater than some threshold, up to topological symmetry), then set <i>k</i>
    = 0 otherwise, set <i>k = k + 1</i>. If <i>k</i> is greater than some
    predefined amount, terminate the search.</li>
  </ol>

<p>The termination criteria can be interpreted as follows. Upon termination
  there have been <i>S</i> consecutive attempts to generate a new configuration
  and each has failed. This is similar to tossing a coin <i>k</i> times and
  observing &quot;heads&quot; on each toss. The Bayes estimator for the bias on
  the coin is (<i>k</i>+1) / (<i>k</i>+2); thus the probability of observing a
  &quot;tail&quot; (or a new configuration) is 1/(<i>k</i>=2). At <i>k</i>=20
  this probability is less than 5%.</p>

<p>Once the search is completed, the collection of configurations is pruned
  by removing all configurations in which the average potential energy is
  greater than the minimum observed average potential energy plus some
  predefined threshold.</p>

<h1><a id="Running">Running the Calculation</a></h1>

<p>Flexible Alignment operates on all of the currently loaded molecules. To
  set up a calculation, load a collection of molecules into MOE. Then, use
  <span class="nobr"><b>MOE | Footer | <i>forcefield</i></b></span> to select
  an appropriate forcefield (e.g. MMFF94 for small molecule alignment). Open
  the Flexible Alignment panel by selecting <b><nobr>MOE | Compute | Flexible
  Alignment</nobr></b>. Depending on the size and number of molecules, the
  search may take some time.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> The speed of the calculation decreases <i>rapidly</i> with
  the degree of freedom of the system. Hence for aligning multiple molecules,
  if the situation allows, one may consider using a rigid template (by fixing
  the template molecule) and aligning one molecule to the template at a time,
  and repeat the process for several possibilities of the rigid template.</p>

<i>-&nbsp;kT&nbsp;</i>log&nbsp;<i>F&nbsp;+&nbsp;U</i>.  In this equation,
<i>U</i> is the average potential energy of the molecules in the alignment
(the quantity in the <tt>U</tt> field) and <i>F</i> is the value of the
<i>P</i>-density overlap function (the quantity in the <tt>F</tt> field).

    <td><tt>dU</tt></td>
    <td><tt>float</tt></td>
    <td>The average strain energy of the molecules in the alignment in
    kcal/mol less the smallest such strain with the chiral class.</td>

    <td>The chiral class number. Unconstrained chiral centers will, in
    general, be inverted during the search. The actual chirality of each
    such chiral center contributes to the chiral class which is used to
    separate alignments on output (and separate the related scores).</td>

<p>Use the <nobr><b>Compute | Sort</b></nobr> command in the Database Viewer
  to sort the database by increasing <tt>S</tt> or <tt>F</tt>; the alignments
  judged best will then be first in the database. Typically, the top scoring
  few alignments should be investigated. It can happen that a top scoring
  alignment also has a relatively large strain energy in the <tt>U</tt> field.
  Whether a high strain energy is evidence of a poor alignment depends on the
  nature of the receptor to which the molecules are assumed to bind. For
  example, higher strain energies are more acceptable when ligands for enzymes
  and other catalytic receptors are submitted to the calculation.</p>

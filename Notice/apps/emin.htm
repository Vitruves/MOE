<p>The Energy Minimize application in MOE calculates atomic coordinates that
  are local minima of a potential energy function. Energy minimization is
  useful for molecule building, determining low energy conformations,
  conformational search and preparation for molecular dynamics simulations. The
  supported energy functions are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The current MOE forcefield (e.g. Amber99, Amber14:EHT, CHARMM27, MMFF94,
    etc.)</li>
    <li>The MOPAC semi-empirical energy functions (e.g. PM3, AM1, MNDO)</li>
    <li>Third party quantum mechanical (QM) engines such as Gaussian, GAMESS,
    ADF, etc.</li>
  </ul>

<p>The MOPAC and third-party QM energy functions are fundamentally different
  from molecular mechanics forcefields in that they do not view the molecular
  topology as fixed. This allows them to simulate chemical reactions or other
  structural rearrangements. For information on configuring MOPAC to run in
  MOE, please see the section on <a href="qmconfig.htm#MOPAC">MOPAC Engine</a>.
  For information on configuring third-party engines, please see the section on
  the <a href="qmconfig.htm#QMEngines">appropriate program</a>.</p>

<p>In forcefield minimization, the Energy Minimize application is capable of
  calculating constrained geometries through the use of MOE's chiral,
  distance, angle and dihedral restraints. In addition, atoms may be
  constrained with a tether or fixed during the calculation.</p>

<a id="Theory">
<h1>Theory</h1>
</a>

<p>Energy minimization consists of finding a set of atomic coordinates that
  correspond to a local minimum of the molecular energy function (such as the
  potential energy model). This is done by applying large scale non-linear
  optimization techniques to calculate a conformation (near to the starting
  geometry) for which the forces on the atoms are zero.</p>

<p><b>Forcefield Optimization</b>. Non-linear optimization algorithms
  typically have the following structure [Gill&nbsp;1981]. Let
  <i>x<sub>k</sub></i> denote the vector of atomic coordinates at step <i>k</i>
  of the procedure and let <i>U</i> be the energy function. Then,</p>
  <ol>
    <li><i>Test for convergence</i>. If the convergence criteria are satisfied
    (see below), then <i>x<sub>k</sub></i> is returned.</li>
    <li><i>Compute the search direction</i>. Compute a non-zero vector
    <i>p<sub>k</sub></i> called the <i>search direction</i>.</li>
    <li><i>Compute the step size</i>. Compute a non-zero scalar
    <i>a</i><sub><i>k</i></sub>, called the <i>step size</i>, for which
    <span class="nobr"><i>U</i>(<i>x<sub>k</sub></i> +
    <i>a</i><sub><i>k</i></sub> <i>p<sub>k</sub></i>) &lt;
    <i>U</i>(<i>x<sub>k</sub></i>)</span>.</li>
    <li><i>Advance</i>. Set <i>x</i><sub><i>k</i>+1</sub> =
    <i>x<sub>k</sub></i> and <i>k</i> = <i>k</i> + 1 and go to Step 1.</li>
  </ol>

<p>The step size in Step&nbsp;3 is computed by using a safeguarded bicubic
  interpolation search along the search direction. In Step&nbsp;1, the
  optimization is terminated when any of the following three conditions are
  satisfied:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><i>Root Mean Square gradient Test</i>: |grad
    <i>U</i>(<i>x</i><sub><i>k</i></sub>)| &lt; <i>e</i><sub><i>A</i></sub>
    sqrt(<i>n</i>), where <i>e</i><sub><i>A</i></sub> is a predefined constant
    and <i>n</i> is the number of unfixed atoms.</li>
    <li><i>Iteration Limit Test</i>: <i>k</i> &gt; <i>K</i>, where <i>K</i> is
    a predefined upper limit on the maximum number of iterations.</li>
    <li>
      <i>Progress Tests</i>: The following three conditions are simultaneously
      satisfied:

<img src="emin/tests.png" alt=
      "Conditions" class="center" />

<p>In these conditions, <i>T</i> is a predefined constant indicating the
      number of significant figures in <i>U</i> that are required (the
      <i>function test</i>). For example, if <i>T</i> = 10<sup>-6</sup> then
      six figures of accuracy are required.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

<p>If the iteration limit is exceeded then it is typically due to a failure
  of the algorithm. Note that saddle points satisfy criterion 1; the
  conformation should be perturbed slightly and optimization restarted. If
  criterion 3 is satisfied then it is very likely that a local minimum has been
  achieved.</p>

<p>The choice of search direction <i>p<sub>k</sub></i> in Step 2 is what
  distinguishes the different nonlinear optimization methods. MOE uses a
  succession of three methods to effect an energy minimization: Steepest
  Descent (SD), Conjugate Gradient (CG) and Truncated Newton (TN). In SD
  optimization <span class="nobr"><i>p<sub>k</sub></i> = - grad
  <i>U</i>(<i>x<sub>k</sub></i>)</span> ; that is, the search proceeds along
  the direction of the forces. While intuitive, SD is extremely inefficient
  after a few iterations and it is only used when the gradient is extremely
  high. When the gradient is sufficiently small (but still quite high) the CG
  method is used. The Conjugate Gradient (CG) method improves upon SD by
  choosing the next search direction in a way to not undo the progress
  accomplished by the previous step. CG performs well in strained conditions;
  however, it exhibits poor convergence properties. Once the gradient is
  reasonable, the TN method is used.</p>

<p>The Truncated Newton (TN) method is the most efficient large-scale
  nonlinear optimization method known. It exhibits superlinear convergence even
  in highly nonlinear conditions. The Truncated Newton method attempts to use
  curvature information to improve convergence. The Newton direction <i>p</i>
  satisfies:</p>

<img src="emin/newton.png" alt="Newton" class="center" />

<p>where <i>G<sub>k</sub></i> is the second derivative, or Hessian, of
  <i>U</i>. These equations are called the Newton equations. TN solves the
  Newton equations approximately using an iterative linear equation solver. The
  iterative linear equation solver (based on the Linear Conjugate Gradient
  method) is terminated after a small number of iterations; hence the name
  Truncated Newton.</p>

<p><b>Quantum Mechanical Optimization</b>. Using the external MOPAC
  semi-empirical QM program [Stewart&nbsp;1993], calculations can use PM3, AM1,
  MNDO or MINDO/3 as the energy model. Third party QM programs such as Gaussian
  or GAMESS (reference below) provide a wide range of energy models:
  semi-empirical, Hartree-Fock, post-Hartree-Fock or Density Functional Theory
  (DFT). These programs are parameterized for much of the periodic table, and
  can calculate geometries, transition states, vibrational spectra,
  thermodynamic quantities and force constants for molecules, radicals and
  ions. They also use different optimization methodology from MOE and a
  complete description is beyond the scope of this document.</p>

<h1>Running an Energy Minimization</h1>
</a>

<p>In general, the following steps should be taken to locate an energy
  minimum:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Select and configure the forcefield and related parameters with the
    <span class="menu">MOE | Footer | <i>forcefield</i></span> button.
    Configure the periodic system parameters with <span class="menu">MOE |
    Footer | PBC</span>, the periodic boundary conditions button (if the
    crystal parameters have been set, the button label will be the current
    space group).</li>
    <li>Add Hydrogens and Lone Pair atoms as required using the <span class=
    "menu">MOE | Edit | Build | Hydrogens | Add Hydrogens</span> menu items.
    Alternatively, the Energy Minimize panel can add/remove hydrogen and lone
    pair atoms as required by the current forcefield.</li>
    <li>Decide which atoms are to be held fixed in space (i.e. frozen during
    the minimization calculation). Fixed atoms can be detected using
    <span class="menu">MOE | Select | Potential | Fixed</span> and modified
    with <span class="menu">MOE | Edit | Potential | Fix</span> or <span class=
    "menu">MOE | Edit | Potential | Unfix</span>. If a large protein is in a
    highly strained state, it is a good idea to fix the backbone or C-alpha
    atoms. Alternatively, the Energy Minimize panel also allows temporary (only
    in effect during minimization) tethers to be set up for common
    situations.</li>
    <li>Decide if restraints are to be added to the system (to constrain
    geometry). Use <span class="menu">MOE | Edit | Potential | Restrain</span>
    to add distance, angle and dihedral restraints. Use <span class="menu">MOE
    | Footer | <i>forcefield</i> | Restraints</span> to review or delete
    restraints.</li>
  </ol>

<p>When ready to perform the energy minimization, choose <span class=
  "menu">MOE | Compute | Energy Minimize</span> and the Energy Minimize window
  will appear. The panel has four &quot;modes&quot; each of which can be
  selected by pressing on the vertical mode selector on the left side of the
  window:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>General.</b> Forcefield minimization (default) with emphasis on
    tether layers.</li>
    <li><b>Domain.</b> Forcefield minimization with emphasis on rigid body

    <li><b>MOPAC.</b> Semi-empirical energy minimization using MOPAC.</li>
    <li><b>QM.</b> Quantum Mechanics minimization using third-party QM
    engines.</li>

<h1>Database Minimization</h1>
</a>

<p>
In many instances, a database contains a collection of molecules whose
structures should be energy minimized.  Open the database in the
<a href="../mdb/db.htm"><span class="nobr"><b>Database Viewer</b></span></a>
and choose <span class="menu">DBV | Compute | Molecule | Energy
Minimize</span> or change the <span class="nobr"><b>Input Data</b></span>
to <span class="nobr"><b>MDB File</b></span> and specify the input
database.  If necessary, set the desired forcefield
via <span class="menu">MOE | Footer | <a href=
"../moe/pot.htm"><i>forcefield</i></a></span>.
Additional GUI entries become active when performing Database Minimization:

      file will be minimized.</td>

  </table>

<p>All the previously described methods and options can be used for the
  minimization. Press <b>OK</b> to start the calculation using MOE or MOE/web.
  Progress information
  is displayed in the MOE window and written to the <span class="nobr"><b>SVL
  Commands</b></span> window.  If running from <b>Batch</b>, the
  <a href="../moe/hpc.htm#JobManager">Job Manager</a> panel can be
  used to track the job status.  The updated output database will be written
  to the job directory, along with any files that are created during the
  calculation.
  For example, if Database Minimization is being run via MOE/web on
  <tt>sample_database.mdb</tt>, all of the input and output files for the
  calculations will be contained in <tt>sample_database_minfiles</tt>, which
  will be created in the current directory. If MOE is running in
  <a href="../install/smp_inst.htm">MPU mode</a>, QM calculations being run
  in MOE are automatically distributed to each node of the cluster.

<p>The Right Hand Side (RHS) Button Bar is a collection of procedures and
  capabilities in MOE for conducting interactive ligand modification and energy
  minimization in the active site of a flexible receptor. It provides for:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Assigning coordinate restraints on atoms to discourage movement.</li>
    <li>Drawing molecular surfaces to highlight steric clashes.</li>
    <li>Interactive modification of ligands and geometry optimization.</li>
    <li>Estimating binding affinities and ligand properties.</li>
    <li>Control of multiple receptors and ligands.</li>
  </ol>
<a id="ButtonBar"></a>
<p>Interactive structure-based drug design (SBDD) is generally conducted
  using the MOE Window, in particular the MOE Button Bar:</p>

<p>A typical interactive modeling session will involve loading molecular data
  into MOE, isolating a ligand in an active site, drawing molecular surfaces
  and repeatedly making modifications to the ligand and optimizing the geometry
  of the modifications using energy minimization.</p>

<p>The molecular data will typically have atomic coordinate restraints
  applied to ensure that the receptor or ligand scaffold atoms do not move too
  much. These restraints are added as part of the QuickPrep preparation
  procedure. MOE files are capable of saving restraint information and
  molecular data from a previously prepared MOE session, and so may be used
  without further preparation.</p>

<p>Ligand properties (such as molecular weight, logP and TPSA) may be
  displayed and Generalized Born binding affinity estimates can be calculated
  as part of the energy minimization procedure. Active site analysis
  applications like Molecular Surfaces, Contact Statistics and Electrostatic
  Maps may be applied and 2D protein-ligand interaction diagrams can be
  calculated.</p>

<a id="Preparation"></a>
<h1>Data Preparation</h1>

<p>MOE has been designed for working with multiple macromolecular receptor
  and ligand molecules, which must first be loaded into MOE. Typically,
  receptor-ligand complexes are initially read from PDB format files, prepared
  for use with the application <a href="#QuickPrep">QuickPrep</a> and stored in
  a MOE file (to save the preparation results). QuickPrep preparation data
  consists of restraint tethers on atoms, ligand identification annotations,
  hydrogen atoms and refined coordinates. Receptors and ligands can be read
  from different files (e.g. a receptor from a PDB file and a ligand from a 3D
  MOL file). It is worthwhile to expend some effort in preparing a
  receptor-ligand complex and saving the results to a MOE file for subsequent
  use; in this way, a good initial starting point can be used repeatedly
  without having to prepare the structure each time.</p>

<a id="OpenCloseSave"></a>
<a id="Open"></a>
<h2>Open, Close and Save Files</h2>

<div class="floatright"><img src="ligx/fileopen.png" alt="File Open"
  class="floatright" /></div>

<p>The <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Open</span> button raises the <a href=
  "../moe/gui/fileopen.htm">Open</a> panel. Select a file in the list (or
  change directories prior to selecting a file) and press <b>OK</b>. Typically
  MOE, PDB, Tripos MOL2 or MDL MOL files are relevant for structure based
  design. Recent directories are available from the pull-down in the file name
  text field.</p>

<p><b>Note!</b> The MOE Button Bar is customizable and in some cases the
  <b>Open</b> button may raise a custom panel different from the default.</p>

<p>The <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Close</span> button will delete all
  data in MOE (after a confirmation prompt). Use <a href=
  "../moe/gui/system.htm"><span class="menu">MOE | RHS | System</span></a> to
  delete a subset of the system (including related surfaces).</p>

<p><b>Warning!</b> Once cleared, molecular data cannot be recovered (unless
  it was previously saved to disk).</p>
<p><a id="Save"></a>
Use <span class="menu">MOE | File |
  Save</span> to save the contents of the MOE Window to disk. The data can be
  saved in one of a number of file formats; however, if the data is not saved
  to a MOE file then QuickPrep annotations and preparations such as atom
  position tethers and ligand identifications may be lost. See <a href=
  "filesave.htm">Saving the System</a> for more information.</p>

  <!--In QuickPrep calculations, the receptor atoms far from the ligand are held

</p>//-->
   Before performing calculations on receptor-ligand complexes in an
  interactive structure-based design session, the molecular data must be
  prepared. If a structure is already prepared then this preparation procedure
  can be skipped. A prepared structure will have all of its hydrogens present;
  use <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Hydrogens</span> to check for the presence
  of explicit hydrogens. Unprepared files, such as PDB files, may contain
  missing atoms, alternate geometry or other crystallographic artifacts. See
  <a href="structprep.htm">Preparing Protein and Protein Complex Data</a> for
  more details on preparing PDB files and correcting problems (e.g., with
  ligand topology). With reasonably good quality starting data, the following
  procedure will be adequate for structure-based design:</p>
  <ol>
    <li class="margin"><b>Verify&nbsp;Ligand</b>. Often the ligand topology in
    PDB files is not correct (due to coordinate errors and the lack of such
    information in PDB files). Use <a href="../apps/view2d.htm"><span class=
    "menu">MOE | RHS | Ligand | 2D Molecules</span></a> to calculate 2D
    depictions of the ligands in MOE. Use <a href="#SiteView"><span class=
    "menu">SiteView</span></a> to isolate the ligands (stick) and their
    receptor environments (line) in the MOE Window (Make sure that there are no
    atoms selected before pressing <b>SiteView</b>.) If bond orders, charges or
    connectivity of a ligand of interest are not correct then the <a href=
    "#Build">Builder</a> must be used to make corrections.</li>
    <li class="margin">

      <a id="ChooseLigand"></a>
      <b>Choose&nbsp;Ligand</b>.

      QuickPrep can handle multiple ligands; however, many receptor-ligand
      complex files contain molecules that are not of interest or are copies of
      a ligand of interest. In such cases, the <b>SiteView</b> command will
      isolate and display all such molecules. Use <span class="menu">MOE | RHS
      | Ligand | Choose Ligand</span> to manually select the ligand of
      interest. To do this, clear the atom selection and select the atoms of
      the ligand of interest. (<tt>Ctrl</tt>+click will select all of the atoms
      of a ligand provided that it is contained in a single residue.)
      Alternatively, the <a href="../moe/gui/system.htm">System Manager</a> can
      be used to select subsets of the atoms. Then, issue the <b>Choose
      Ligand</b> command.

      <p><b>Note!</b> Choose Ligand is implemented by setting all other ligands
      to be considered as Receptor atoms. They will still be part of the system
      but will be considered as non-ligands by MOE. If multiple complexes are
      present, then &quot;other ligands&quot; means other ligands in the same
      tag grouping as defined in the <a href="../moe/gui/system.htm">System
      Manager</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="margin"><b>QuickPrep</b>. Use <span class="menu">MOE | RHS |
    QuickPrep</span> to raise the QuickPrep preparation application. QuickPrep
    will delete distant solvent, add hydrogens, install tethers, calculate
    charges and perform initial refinement of the system (see below). QuickPrep
    can handle multiple independent complexes; however, it is usually best to
    prepare each complex separately and save them to separate files.</li>
  </ol>

<a id="QuickPrepBio"></a>
<h2>QuickPrep &ndash; Prepare Structures for Biologics</h2>

<p>Preparing initial protein data is a critical step in a biologics workflow.
  If the structure is already prepared, this preparation procedure can be
  skipped.</p>

<p>A prepared structure will have completely populated heavy atoms in the
  regions of interest, and all of its hydrogens present. Unprepared files, such
  as PDB files, may contain missing atoms, alternate geometry or other
  crystallographic artifacts. Running QuickPrep assumes reasonably good quality
  starting data. For structures with more serious problems, or for in-depth
  analysis, see <a href="structprep.htm">Preparing Protein and Protein Complex
  Data</a>.</p>

<p>For macromolecular studies, QuickPrep is used to cap termini for large
  loops and endgaps, or to build small loops. It uses <a href=
  "protonate3d.htm">Protonate3D</a> for adding and placing hydrogens, and can
  assign tethers and perform structure refinement.</p>

<a id="QuickPrepRun"></a>
<h2>Running QuickPrep</h2>

<p>The purpose of <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | QuickPrep</span> is to
  prepare one or more systems (defined by their tag in the <a href=
  "../moe/gui/system.htm">System Manager</a>) for structure-based drug design
  involving energy minimization or biologics studies involving refinement. The
  following panel will be raised:</p>


<img src="ligx/ligx_panel.png" class="center" />
<table class="noborder">
  <tr>
    <td><b>Prepare</b></td>
    <td>
      If <span class="nobr"><b>Use Structure Preparation</b></span> is
      enabled, the <a href="structprep.htm">Structure Preparation</a>
      application is run with default settings. In this case, when a
      structure is missing atoms, the Structure Preparation build loop
      protocol is used to build small loops &mdash; breaks of up to 10
      residues and terminal outgaps of up to 5 residues. For larger gaps,
      there are two possible treatments; these options only have effect if
      Use Structure Preparation is enabled:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Preserve Sequence and Neutralize</b>. The endpoints adjoining
        empty residues are neutralized, and the empty residues are
        preserved.</li>
        <li><b>Cap Breaks and Delete</b>. Capping groups are added to
        endpoints adjoining empty residues, and the empty residues are
        deleted.</li>
      </ul>Most macromolecular structure data do not contain hydrogen atoms.
      Additionally, the ionization state of protein residues is often in
      question. If <b>Use Protonate3D for Protonation</b> is enabled, the
      Protonate3D [Labute&nbsp;2009] methodology is used to determine
      ionization state and add hydrogens. Otherwise, hydrogen atoms are added
      in extended conformations according to the current atomic ionization
      states. If <span class="nobr"><b>Allow ASN/GLN/HIS &quot;Flips&quot; in
      Protonate3D</b></span> is also enabled, then terminal amides,
      sulfonamide and imidazole groups will be permitted to flip to optimize
      the hydrogen bond network.

  <tr>
    <td><b>Delete</b></td>
    <td>Often, receptor-ligand complexes contain many water molecules. Some
    of these water molecules may be important to maintain receptor structure
    or to mediate ligand interactions. The remaining water molecules are
    generally uninteresting and may be deleted. If this option is enabled,
    water molecules farther than 4.5&nbsp;&Aring; from any receptor or ligand
    atom will be deleted.</td>

  <tr>
    <td><b>Tether</b></td>
    <td>
      Typically, receptor atoms are constrained during geometry optimization
      so that they do not deviate too much from their initial (experimental)
      coordinates. QuickPrep will add tether restraints to receptor, ligand,
      and solvent atoms of the system according to which of the
      <b>Receptor</b>, <b>Ligand</b>, and <b>Solvent</b> checkboxes have been
      enabled. If a checkbox is off, no corresponding tethers will be
      created. If the corresponding <b>Hydrogens</b> checkbox to the right is
      enabled, then hydrogen atoms will also be tethered, otherwise the
      hydrogen atoms will not be tethered.

      <p>The <b>Strength</b> and <b>Buffer</b> parameters control the
      strength and shape of the tether restraint on an atom. The greater the
      Strength, the less the atom will deviate from its initial coordinates.
      The Buffer value specifies the extent of the flat bottom of the
      flat-bottom restraint, described in <a href=
      "../moe/pot.htm#Restraints">Atom Restraints and Tethers</a>.</p>

      <p>Note that the tethers remain in the system after QuickPrep has been
      run. They can be viewed in the <a href=
      "../moe/pot.htm#Restraints">Potential Setup</a> panel Restraints page,

    all non-ligand atoms to be fixed.</br>
    The pulldown option can be used to specify how the binding site is
    defined.  By default, all <b>Ligands</b> will be used.  Select
    <b>Dummy&nbsp;Atoms</b> for example to use the results of
    <a href="sitefind.htm"><b>Site Finder</b></a>, or
    <b>Selected</b> to use a custom definition.  In all cases, the site
    definition will be split by Tag and restricted to active atoms.
    Dummy atoms, if present, are always excluded from refinement.
    Use the <b>?</b> button to the right to verify the selection &ndash;
    the atoms will briefly &quot;flash&quot; in the MOE Window.</br>
    An exception can be made for hydrogens near the binding site:

    <br />
    <b>Note!</b> All atoms matching the binding-site selection
    (e.g. if <b>Ligands</b> is selected and there is more than one ligand)
    will be treated equally for the purposes of calculating the receptor atoms

<p>In summary, a prepared molecular system will have one or more identified
  ligands with correct topology, reasonable ionization states and proton
  coordinates, tether restraints on the heavy atoms of the receptor and no
  unimportant water molecules. This prepared state configuration is assumed for
  optimal display by the <a href="#SiteView"><b>SiteView</b></a> rendering

  <!-- ============================= VISUALIZATION ========================= -->

<a id="Visualization"></a>
<h1>Visualization</h1>

<p>The MOE Button Bar provides a number of commands for visualizing the
  ligand and receptor active site. The visualization commands are designed to
  analyze active sites, protein-ligand interactions and to provide information
  about which atoms have tether restraints (normally added in the <a href=
  "#QuickPrep"><b>QuickPrep</b></a> preparation steps). For this section, we
  will assume that a prepared receptor-ligand complex is in the MOE Window.
  Also, a good working knowledge of the operation of the <a href=
  "../moe/gui/mainwin.htm">MOE Window</a> is assumed. The angle of view and
  zoom of the MOE Window is controlled with the <a href=
  "../moe/gui/mouse.htm">mouse</a> (see <a href=
  "../moe/gui/mainwin.htm">Rotating, Translating and Zooming Atoms</a>). For
  more information on selecting atoms, see <a href=
  "../moe/gui/mainwin.htm#UsingMouse">Selecting Atoms Using the Mouse</a>.</p>
  <div class="floatright"><img src="ligx/sys_popup.png" alt=
  "System Manager" class="floatright" /></div>

<a id="System"></a>
<h2>The System Manager &ndash; Control Multiple Complexes</h2>

<p>One of the most important buttons on the MOE Button Bar is the
  <b>System</b> button: it raises the System Manager which is used for rapid
  control of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Visibility of atoms and surfaces.</li>
    <li>Active, Inert and Selected state of atoms (independent of
    visibility).</li>
    <li>Coloring and rendering mode of atoms.</li>
    <li>Names of chains and chain groupings.</li>
  </ul>

<p>For detailed information, please refer to the documentation on the
  <a href="../moe/gui/system.htm">System Manager</a>.</p>

<a id="SiteView"></a>
<h2>The SiteView Button</h2>

<div class="floatright"><img src="ligx/siteview.jpg" class="floatright" /></div>

<p>The <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | SiteView</span> is a kind of
  &quot;reset&quot; or &quot;home base&quot; for structure-based drug design.
  <b>SiteView</b> renders the molecular system according to a convention which
  is designed to provide feedback regarding which atoms belong to the receptor
  and which atoms are ligand atoms as well as to focus on the active sites of
  receptor-ligand complexes. First ensure that no atoms selected. Pressing
  <b>SiteView</b> will</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Isolate the ligand in the active site by hiding distant receptor and
    solvent atoms. Distant backbone ribbons will be hidden.</li>
    <li>Render the receptor atoms in line mode and ligands in stick mode.</li>
    <li>Hide non-polar hydrogens and show polar hydrogens.</li>
  </ol>

<p>Use the <a href="../moe/gui/system.htm">System Manager</a> to color the
  receptor carbons differently from the ligand (e.g., dark green). <b>Note!</b>
  In previous versions of MOE, this color was integrated with the Active Site
  button. This coloring is not performed by SiteView in order to support
  multiple receptor-ligand complexes.</p>

<p><b>SiteView</b> will affect all atoms in the system and take all atoms
  into account. The active site (within a System tag group) is defined by
  default to be those residues with atoms (Receptor or Solvent) within
  4.5&nbsp;A of <i>any</i> ligand. <b>Note!</b> This cutoff value is defined in
  the <b>SiteView Cutoff</b> text field of the <a href=
  "../appendix/settings.htm#QuickPrep">QuickPrep</a> page of the Configuration
  Options panel.</p>

<p>When a single ligand is to be modified with the small molecule <a href=
  "../moe/molsystems/build.htm">Builder</a>, explicit display of the ligand
  hydrogens is required for substitution. Select the ligand with Ctrl+Left (to
  select the residue) or by using the <a href="../moe/gui/system.htm">System
  Manager</a> and then press the <span class="menu">MOE | RHS |
  Hydrogens</span> to cycle through the hydrogen display until all hydrogens
  are visible. <b>Note!</b> If there are no explicit hydrogens then the system
  should be prepared with <a href="#QuickPrep"><span class=
  "menu">QuickPrep</span></a> button.</p>

<p><b>Warning!</b> If there are selected atoms in the system, then these, and
  only these, atoms will be considered &quot;ligands&quot;.</p>

<a id="HideShow"></a>
<h2>Hide and Show Menus</h2>

<p>The <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Hide</span> and <span class=
  "menu">Show</span> menus provide visibility control over classes of atoms.
  Hiding and showing individual molecular subsystems is most easily done using
  the <a href="../moe/gui/system.htm"><span class="menu">MOE | RHS |
  System</span></a> Manager; however, in certain circumstances the Button Bar
  menus are preferable. <b>Note!</b> The commands in the <b>Hide</b> and

    <td>
      The <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Surface</span> menu provides
      commands to create surfaces around receptors and ligands in the system.
      These &quot;Quick&quot; surfaces are those most useful in
      structure-based drug design and are created with coloring designed to
      show the color of atoms in the system:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Receptor</b>. Creates a Connolly-type molecular surface using
        receptor atoms only near any ligand atom in the system. The surface
        is colored by nearest atom with hydrogen bond information (direction
        of polar hydrogens and lone pairs) overlaid.</li>
        <li><b>Ligand</b>. Creates a Connolly-type molecular surface using
        ligand atoms only. The surface is colored by nearest atom with
        hydrogen bond information (direction of polar hydrogens and lone
        pairs) overlaid.</li>
        <li><b>Interaction (VDW)</b>. Creates an accessible surface (line
        mode) using receptor atoms only near any ligand atom in the system.
        This surface shows the onset of van der Waals clash (a 0-potential
        energy contour of the van der Waals interaction energy with a water
        molecule probe). The color of the surface is the same as that shown
        in the <a href="../moe/gui/system.htm">System Manager</a>.</li>
        <li><b>Protein</b>. Creates a Connolly-type molecular surface using
        all of the receptor atoms. The surface is colored by nearest atom
        with hydrogen bond information (direction of polar hydrogens and lone
        pairs) overlaid.</li>
        <li><b>Protein Patches</b>. Creates both electrostatic
        (excess charge) and hydrophobic
        <a href="surfmap.htm#ProteinPatches">surface patches</a>
        to show regions of significance with respect to
        protein-protein interactions.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>More sophisticated surfaces such as Electrostatic Maps and Contact
      Statistics can be created with the <a href="surfmap.htm">Surfaces and
      Maps</a> application, which provides more coloring options and
      transparency settings. Surfaces and Maps can also be used to change the
      coloring, transparency and material properties of the surfaces created
      in the <b>Surface</b> menu. This application can be started with the
      <b>Surfaces and Maps</b> command in the <b>Surface</b> menu.</p>

      <p><b>Note!</b> Inactive receptors and ligands are ignored and no
      surface will be created. A receptor or ligand is considered inactive if
      it has no active atoms (as shown in the <a href=
      "../moe/gui/system.htm">System Manager</a>).</p>

      <p><b>Note!</b> Each active receptor or ligand is treated separately
      and a separate surface will be created for each one.</p>

      <p><b>Note!</b> The surfaces do not automatically update if the atomic
      coordinates change. Issue the command again to update the surface
      (which will delete the old surface).</p>

      <p>To delete Quick surfaces:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the <b>Clear</b> command in the <b>Surface</b> menu.</li>
        <li>Use <a href="surfmap.htm">Surfaces and Maps</a>.</li>

<h2>Measure Interatomic Distances, Angles and Dihedrals</h2>

<p>The MOE Footer can be used to measure distances, angles and dihedrals.
  When 2, 3 or 4 atoms are selected, the MOE Footer will adapt accordingly and
  display distance, angle and dihedral measurements (and means to change them).
  See <a href="../moe/gui/mainwin.htm#Footer">MOE Footer</a> for more
  information.</p>
  <div class="floatright"><img src="ligx/mcreate.png" alt=

<p>The <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Measure</span> menu and the equivalent
  <span class="menu">MOE | Edit | Measure</span> menu provides commands to
  measurement meters that are displayed in the MOE Window and continuously
  updated as atomic coordinates change. Choose one of</p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Distance</b> to measure and display the distance between 2
    atoms.</li>
    <li><b>Angle</b> to measure and display the angle between 3 atoms.</li>
    <li><b>Dihedral</b> to measure and display the dihedral angle between 4
    atoms.</li>
  </ol>

<p>The SVL Commands line in the MOE Window will change into a prompt (see
  figure) providing for selection of the measurement type (distance, angle or
  dihedral), then click on either 2, 3, or 4 atoms as required. If you make a
  mistake in the process, click on the selected atom to deselect it.
  Alternatively, the current selection can be used to specify a meter. Once
  created, the meter appears in the MOE Window as a colored line with a
  measured value. Clicking on the <font color="red">X</font> closes the
  <b>Measure</b> menu and restores the MOE menu bar.</p>

<p>The last meter created can be removed by pressing <span class=
  "nobr"><b>Remove Last</b></span> and previously created measurement meters
  can be removed via the <b>Remove</b> items in the <b>Measure</b> menu. Select
  the atoms for which meters are to be removed (or the meter lines themselves)
  then select one of <b>Remove Distances</b>, <b>Remove Angles</b>, <b>Remove
  Dihedrals</b> or <b>Remove All</b> from the menu. <b>Warning!</b> If no atoms
  are selected, then all measurement meters of the selected type will be
  removed from the MOE Window. Meter removals and additions cannot be
  undone.</p><!-- ============================= LIGAND MENU  =========================== -->

<h2>Ligand Properties</h2>

<p>The <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Ligand | Ligand Properties</span>
  command toggles the display of calculated ligand properties. Issue the
  command once to enable the property display and again to disable it.
  Properties will be automatically calculated if there is a single active
  ligand in the system. If there is more than one (or none at all) a message
  will be displayed and the properties will not be calculated. Use <span class=
  "menu">MOE | RHS | System</span> to activate or de-activate ligands so that
  there is only one active ligand.</p>
  <div class="floatright"><img src="ligx/ligprop.png" alt=
  "QuickPrep Properties" class="floatright" /></div>

<p>The calculated 2D ligand properties are displayed in the top left corner
  of the MOE Window. Use <span class="nobr"><b>MOE | Render | Setup</b></span>
  to configure the color of the properties text (if, for example, they cannot
  be seen on the current background). See <a href=
  "../appendix/viewsetup.htm">Visualization Setup</a>. The font properties
  (size, bold, etc.) can be controlled in <span class="nobr"><b>MOE | Render |
  Draw</b></span>.</p>

<p>The properties divide into two categories: those that depend only on the
  ligand connectivity and topological state (2D) and those that depend on
  coordinates and interactions with the receptor (3D). The 2D properties are
  continuously updated as the ligand is modified with the <a href=
  "#Build">Builder</a>; the 3D properties are updated after each <a href=
  "#Minimize">energy minimization</a> using the MOE Button Bar or the
  Builder.</p>

<p>The calculated 2D properties are <a href="../quasar/descr.htm">MOE
  Descriptors</a> relevant to structure-based drug design:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><tt>toxic</tt> &ndash; An assessment of the toxicity or mutagenicity of
    the ligand using a rule-based method [Kazius&nbsp;2005].</li>
    <li><tt>weight</tt> &ndash; The molecular weight calculated with values
    from the CRC Handbook [CRC&nbsp;1994].</li>

      [Gerber&nbsp;1998, Wang&nbsp;2007]
      <ul>
        <li><tt>logP</tt> &ndash; The log octanol/water partition
        coefficient.</li>
        <li><tt>logD</tt> &ndash; The log distribution coefficient at

        <li><tt>logS</tt> &ndash; The log solubility coefficient.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

<p>Additional 3D properties are calculated after each <a href=
  "#Minimize"><b>Minimize</b></a>. If the ligand is subsequently modified then
  these additional properties will no longer be displayed and another energy
  minimization must be performed so that they can be recalculated. The energy
  minimization will optimize the potential energy of the receptor-ligand
  complex. From the resulting coordinates, several properties are
  calculated:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><tt>strain</tt> &ndash; The local strain energy of the ligand
    conformation. The ligand is subjected to energy minimization, isolated from
    the rest of the molecular system. The strain energy is the difference
    between the ligand conformation energy in the bound state and the energy of
    the isolated local minimum. The value in parentheses to the right is the
    strain energy divided by the number of heavy atoms in the ligand (the
    strain efficiency). The <tt>rmsd</tt> at the far right is the superposition
    distance between the bound conformation and the isolated local minimum
    conformation.</li>
    <li><tt>solvation</tt> &ndash; The molecular mechanics generalized Born
    interaction energy is the non-bonded interaction energy between the
    receptor and the ligand and comprises van der Waals, Coulomb and
    generalized Born implicit solvent interaction energies [Labute&nbsp;2008].
    Ligand and receptor strain energies are not taken into account. The
    parenthetical value to the right is the interaction energy divided by the
    number of heavy atoms in the ligand (interaction efficiency). Solvent
    molecules are ignored in the calculation.</li>
    <li><tt>affinity</tt> &ndash; The estimated binding affinity is that of the
    GBVI/WSA&nbsp;dG scoring function, reported in units of kcal/mol. The
    parenthetical value to the right is the affinity divided by the number of
    heavy atoms in the ligand (the efficiency). Solvent molecules are ignored
    in the calculation.</li>
  </ul>

<p><b>Note!</b> It is possible to customize the Ligand Properties display by
  using custom SVL functions. In such a case, the number and type of the
  properties may be different from the description above.</p>

<a id="RVectors"></a>
<h2>Ligand R-Vectors</h2>

<p>Modifications to ligands such as the addition of functionals may result in
  poor steric interactions with the receptor. The purpose of the R-Vector
  display is to provide information about potential steric clash at
  substitution locations on a ligand.</p>
  <div class="floatright"><img src="ligx/ligrvec.jpg" alt=
  "Ligand R-Vectors" class="floatright" /></div>

<p>The <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Ligand | Ligand R-Vectors</span>
  command toggles the display of &quot;exit vectors&quot; on active ligand
  molecules. These graphical arrows are drawn along visible Q&ndash;H bonds
  when a methyl substitution is likely to be free of steric clash. R-Vectors
  will only be displayed along <i>visible</i> explicit hydrogens. Select a
  ligand of interest and use <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Hydrogens</span>
  until all hydrogens are visible. For each hydrogen attached to a ligand, a
  virtual methyl group is positioned along the heavy atom to hydrogen bond with
  the appropriate bond length. A van der Waals interaction energy is calculated
  with every active atom in the system (leaving out 1-2, 1-3 and scaling the
  virtual 1-4 interactions). If the resulting energy is less than
  2&nbsp;kcal/mol, the hydrogen is deemed to be a candidate attachment point.
  This energy threshold can be adjusted on the Builder page of the <a href=
  "../appendix/settings.htm">Configuration Options</a> panel.</p>

<p><b>Note!</b> All active atoms will interact with the virtual methyls, even
  overlaid ligands. Use the System Manager to activate or deactivate ligands
  and receptors.</p>

<p>The information displayed by the Ligand R-Vectors is similar to that of
  the <a href="#Surface">Interaction (VDW) surface</a> and the same parameters
  are used (van der Waals radii and well depths). However, it is important to
  keep in mind that a virtual methyl group may clash with the ligand itself
  (not just the receptor). A clash with the ligand means that some sort of
  conformational change is required. Thus, the lack of an R-Vector may also
  mean that some sort of ligand movement (translation, rotation,
  conformational) is required to accommodate the methyl group.</p>

<a id="Torsions"></a>
<h2>Ligand Torsions</h2>

<p>Ligand conformations, whether in crystal structures or as a result of
  modifications, may have torsion angles in poor geometry.  The purpose of
  the Ligand Torsions display is to provide information about whether
  the dihedral angle of rotatable bonds are consistent (statistically) with
  angles observed in small molecule crystal structure data.</p>
  <div class="floatright"><img src="ligx/ligtor.png" alt=
  "Ligand Torsions" class="floatright" /></div>

<p>The <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Ligand | Ligand Torsions</span>
  command toggles the display of torsion quality cylinders on active ligand
  molecules. These graphical cylinders drawn along visible rotatable bonds
  are color coded to indicate quality: green for good, orange for warning
  and red for bad.</p>

<p>A colored bar at the top of the <span class="nobr">
  <a href="../moe/gui/mainwin.htm#DihedralProfile">Dihedral Profile</a></span>
  plot shows the torsion quality when rotating the selected bond. By default,
  this bar is hidden if Mogul is available.
  </p>

<p>The underlying software uses the Torsion Library jointly
  developed by the University of Hamburg, Center for Bioinformatics, Hamburg,
  Germany and F. Hoffmann-La-Roche Ltd., Basel, Switzerland.
  The methodology is more fully described in
  [Sch&auml;rfer&nbsp;2013] [Guba&nbsp;2016] [Penner&nbsp;2022].
  The torsion library is available in the supplementary information to
  [Penner&nbsp;2022].</p>

<a id="Duplicate"></a>
<h2>Duplicate a Ligand</h2>

<p>Use <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Ligand | Duplicate</span> to create a
  copy of a ligand. A single connected ligand must be selected in the MOE
  Window or an error will result. The ligand atoms, residues and chains are
  duplicated along with membership in any atom sets, restraints, tethers, etc.
  The chain name of the newly created ligand will have a numeric copy number
  appended; for example, a copy of <tt>MyLigand</tt> will be given the chain
  name <tt>MyLigand&nbsp;(2)</tt>. The original ligand will be hidden and
  de-activated (made inert) and the created copy will have all of its atoms
  selected.</p>

<a id="MinimizeV"></a>
<h2>Minimize in Isolation</h2>

<p>Use <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Ligand | Minimize (Vac)</span> to
  create a duplicate of a ligand and energy minimize its coordinates in
  isolation (without any receptor or other atoms). A single connected ligand
  must be selected in the MOE Window or an error will result. The ligand is
  duplicated in manner similar to the <b>Duplicate</b> command. The newly
  created copy is energy minimized and superposed back onto the original. The
  chain name of the newly created ligand will have <tt>(Vac)</tt> appended; for
  example, <tt>MyLigand</tt> will become <tt>MyLigand&nbsp;(Vac)</tt>. The
  newly created minimized copy will be de-activated (made inert).</p>

<p>When the minimization is complete, a message will be displayed at the top
  left of the MOE Window for ~5 seconds and printed to the SVL Commands window.
  The message has the form</p>

<pre class="code">
Minimize (Vac): Estrain: ss.sss kcal/mol (e.eee)  rmsd: d.ddd
</pre>

<p>where <tt>ss.sss</tt> is the strain energy (energy of original
  conformation less the energy of the minimized conformation), <tt>e.eee</tt>
  is the strain efficiency: strain energy divided by the number of heavy atoms,
  <tt>d.ddd</tt> is the root mean square deviation between the original
  conformation and the minimized conformation.</p>


  <!-- ========================= LIGAND MODIFICATION ======================= -->

<a id="ModLig"></a>
<h1>Ligand Modification and Constrained Energy Minimization</h1>

<p>The MOE Right Hand Side Button Bar provides a number of commands for
  performing energy minimization calculations and ligand modifications. It is
  assumed there is a receptor-ligand complex in the MOE Window that has been
  prepared with the <a href="#QuickPrep">QuickPrep</a> preparation procedure.
  Press the <a href="#SiteView"><b>SiteView</b></a> button to isolate the
  ligand in the active site. The <a href="#Properties"><span class="menu">MOE |
  RHS | Ligand | Ligand Properties</span></a> command can be used to display
  and monitor ligand properties in the MOE Window. The protocol for ligand
  modification is</p>

<ol>
  <li>Decide which receptor and ligand atoms will be fully flexible.</li>
  <li>Use the small molecule <a href=
  "../moe/molsystems/build.htm">Builder</a> to modify the ligand.</li>
  <li>Use <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Minimize</span> to perform
  constrained energy minimization to optimize the receptor-ligand
  complex.</li>
</ol>

<p>
<a id="Constrain"></a>
The <span class="menu">MOE | RHS |
  Constrain</span> menu is used to change the constraint status of selected
  atoms in the MOE Window. An atom can be either <i>tethered</i>, <i>fixed</i>
  or <i>free</i>. Tethered atoms will be subject to artificial forces during
  <a href="#Minimize">energy minimization</a> to prevent gross movement; fixed
  atoms will not move at all; free atoms are not restrained in any manner. The
  strength and other parameters of the tether restraints are specified in the
  <a href="#QuickPrep">QuickPrep</a> panel.

<p>The <b>Render</b> command in the <b>Constrain</b> menu can be used to
  render the tethered and free atoms differently to reflect their state:</p>
<table class="noborder">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="ligx/line.png" class="icon" alt="line mode atoms" />
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="ligx/ballstick.png" class="icon" alt="ball and stick atoms" />
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p class="caption">tethered</p></td>
    <td><p class="caption">free</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Heavy atoms (non-hydrogen) are rendered in Line mode if they are tethered,
  or Ball and Stick mode if they are free. Ligand hydrogen atoms are rendered
  in Line mode if they are tethered and Ball and Stick mode if they are free.
  Receptor hydrogen atoms are rendered in the same style as the heavy atom to
  which they are attached. Alternatively one can <b>Constrain | Label</b>
  the atoms with their constrain status:
  <tt>(F)</tt>: Fixed, <tt>(T)</tt>: Tethered, <tt>(I)</tt>: Inert.</p>

<p>To <b>remove tether restraints</b> from atoms, <a href=
  "../moe/gui/mainwin.htm#UsingMouse">select the atoms</a> in the MOE Window
  and use <span class="nobr"><b>Constrain | Free</b></span> on the button bar.
  This can be used to allow receptor active site atoms free movement; for
  example, to allow a fully flexible residue sidechain.</p>

<p>To <b>add tether restraints</b> to atoms, <a href=
  "../moe/gui/mainwin.htm#UsingMouse">select the atoms</a> in the MOE Window
  and use <span class="nobr"><b>Constrain | Tether</b></span> on the button
  bar. Generally, hydrogen atoms need not be tethered, allowing them full
  flexibility to form hydrogen bonds. It is also good practice to tether a few
  ligand heavy atoms if certain interactions are to be ensured.</p>

<p>To <b>fix atoms</b> to atoms, <a href=
  "../moe/gui/mainwin.htm#UsingMouse">select the atoms</a> in the MOE Window
  and use <span class="nobr"><b>Constrain | Fix</b></span> on the button bar.
  Use <span class="nobr"><b>Constrain | Unfix</b></span> to remove the fixed
  status without affecting any assigned tether.</p>
<a id="Build"></a>
Use <span class="menu">MOE | RHS |
  Builder</span> to start the small molecule <a href=
  "../moe/molsystems/build.htm">Builder</a> which is used to make modifications
  to the ligand; it can also be used to make minor modifications to the
  receptor. The <span class="menu">MOE | Footer</span> is selection-sensitive
  and can also be used to edit bond lengths, angles and dihedrals: select 2, 3
  or 4 atoms and use the controls provided. Alternatively, the <a href=
  "../proteins/probuild.htm#RotamerExplorer">Protein Builder/Rotamer
  Explorer</a> can be used to explore alternative sidechain conformations or
  make residue mutations. Modifications to ligands are made by selecting atoms
  in the MOE Window and changing their properties in the Builder. Substitutions
  are made by selecting hydrogen atoms in the MOE Window and selecting a
  chemical group in the Builder. See <a href=
  "../moe/molsystems/build.htm">Building and Editing Molecules</a> for
  information on how to use the Builder.
<a id="Build2D"></a>
Use <span class="menu">MOE | RHS |
  Sketch</span> to start an <a href="../moe/sketcher.htm">external
  chemical drawing program</a>. This allows the selected component in the MOE
  Window to be edited in 2D; the changes can be brought back into MOE once
  editing is complete. A 2D sketcher is most suitable for small edits to small
  molecules and is a complementary tool to the 3D small molecule <a href=
  "../moe/molsystems/build.htm">Builder</a>.
<a id="Minimize"></a>
The <span class="menu">MOE | RHS |
  Minimize</span> button will optimize the coordinates of the molecular data in
  the MOE Window. The <b>Minimize</b> button in the <a href=
  "../moe/molsystems/build.htm">Builder</a> is equivalent. Typically, the
  <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | System</span> Manager is used to activate or
  de-activate receptors and ligands so that there is only one set of active
  receptor, ligand and solvent atoms.

<p><img src="ligx/ligrec1.png" style="float:right" alt=
  "QuickPrep receptor setup" /> The <a href="#QuickPrep">QuickPrep prepare
  procedure</a> is typically used to set up for the following protocol:</p>
  <ol>
    <li class="margin">Receptor and solvent atoms far from the ligand are held
    fixed (constrained to not move at all). Typically, an atom is held fixed if
    it is at least 8&nbsp;&Aring; from any ligand atom.</li>
    <li class="margin">Atoms not held fixed in Step&nbsp;1 will be subject to
    any restraints that have been set by the prepare procedure or the <a href=
    "#Constrain"><b>Constrain</b></a> commands. The <span class=
    "menu">Constrain | Render</span> button can be used to visualize the
    tethered status of atoms.</li>
    <li class="margin">A forcefield energy minimization is performed which will
    stop when the root mean square (RMS) gradient of the potential energy falls
    below a certain threshold, by default 0.1&nbsp;kcal/mol&Aring;
    (configurable in the <a href="#QuickPrep"><span class=
    "href">QuickPrep</span></a> panel). The current <a href=
    "../moe/pot.htm">Potential&nbsp;Setup</a> determines the forcefield,
    solvation model and non-bonded interaction cutoff.</li>
  </ol>

<p>The <b>Cancel</b> menu in the top right corner of the MOE Window can be
  used to terminate an energy minimization before it has completed.</p>

<p>If the energy minimization calculation terminates normally, and the Ligand
  Properties are displayed (using the <a href="#Properties"><span class=
  "menu">MOE | RHS | Ligand | Ligand Properties</span></a> button) then binding
  affinity estimates are calculated and the display updated. <b>Note!</b> If an
  energy minimization is performed but the Ligand Properties are not displayed,
  then enable their display and then press <b>Minimize</b> again.</p>

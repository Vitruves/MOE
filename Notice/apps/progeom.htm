<a id="Overview"></a>
<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>As macromolecular crystal structures are determined and refined in an
  increasingly automated fashion, careful assessment of the reliability and
  quality of the resulting models becomes increasingly important, especially
  when these structures are used in the comparative modeling process. The
  Protein Geometry application provides a variety of stereochemical
  measurements for inspection of the structural quality in a given protein:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Backbone bond lengths, angles and dihedrals.</li>
    <li>Ramachandran <i>&phiv;&minus;&psi;</i> dihedral plots.</li>
    <li>Sidechain rotamer quality.</li>
    <li>Nonbonded contact quality.</li>
  </ol>

<p>For the evaluation of the <i>&phiv;&minus;&psi;</i> torsion quality, an
  updated and refined reference dataset [Lovell&nbsp;2003] serves as the basis
  for identifying potentially erroneous protein backbone topologies. The
  sidechain rotamers are assessed by the rotamer strain energies calculated
  from the probability factors obtained from a backbone-dependent rotamer
  library [Dunbrack&nbsp;1997].</p>

<p>The user interface of the Protein Geometry application offers two distinct
  views on the result sets:</p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Scatter plots provide a quick overview of the entire data set (e.g.
    Bond Lengths, <i>&phiv;&minus;&psi;</i> Plots etc.) and allow interactive
    selection of residues of interest. Overall trends can be visualized and
    localized to certain domains within the protein. In addition, the plots may
    be exported into common graphic formats (e.g. GIF, PNG, JPG, EMF, etc.) for
    use in other applications.</li>
    <li>Data Lists give a more detailed representation of the results by
    listing the benchmark data of a particular category in a table. A variety
    of interface controls (e.g. checkboxes for sub-categories of the dataset,
    various possibilities for sorting, sliders, etc.) enable efficient browsing
    and filtering of the results and help in finding potential outliers or
    subsets of interest. The content of the tables may also be copied into the
    clipboard and imported into other applications.</li>
  </ol>

<p>The Report Panel provides a summary of the stereochemical evaluation of a
  given protein in the form of an ASCII file.</p>

  <!-- ============================ METHODOLOGY ============================ -->
<a id="Method"></a>
<h1>Methodology</h1>

<p>This section contains an overview of the methods and calculations
  underlying the distinct functions on the Protein Geometry application.
  Backbone Bond lengths, angles and dihedrals are compared to averages and
  standard deviations of a reference database of high resolution structures
  from the May&nbsp;2007 Protein Data Bank (PDB). The following criteria were
  used to select reference database entries:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Resolution of 1.3&nbsp;&Aring; or better. The electron density map of
    these structures at this range is so clear that alternate occupancies
    become more distinguishable with fewer constraints required during the
    refinement procedure. The level of detail at this resolution should provide
    a more &quot;realistic&quot; - closer to experimental data - dataset when
    used in statistical analysis.</li>
    <li>R<sub>free</sub> value of 0.25 or lower.</li>
    <li>B-Factor values of backbone atoms of 30 or lower.</li>
    <li>Backbone atom occupancy of 100%.</li>
  </ol>

<p>Protein chains with sequence identity of 95% or higher have been removed
  from the collection as well as residues with erroneous backbone topology
  (e.g. incorrect topology or missing atoms). The resulting reference database
  consists of 129,858 residues originating from 556 protein structures.</p>
<p><a id="MethodDefAndVal"></a>
<b>Backbone Definitions
  and Values</b>. The depictions below outline the respective definitions of
  backbone bonds, angles and dihedrals and, for each measurement, list the
  expected values as calculated from the reference database. The reference
  database statistics are for calculating the Z-Scores (number of standard
  deviations from the expected value) of a particular measurement (length,
  angle or dihedral). The atom backbone names are denoted as follows:</p>
<table class="titlebar">
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Atom</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>N</td>
    <td>Backbone nitrogen atom of a residue.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>CA</td>
    <td>Backbone &alpha; carbon atom of a residue.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>C</td>
    <td>Backbone carbonyl carbon atom of a residue.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>O</td>
    <td>Backbone carbonyl oxygen atom of a residue.</td>

    <td>Backbone &alpha; carbon atom of the <i>previous</i> residue.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>pC</td>
    <td>Backbone carbonyl carbon atom of the <i>previous</i> residue.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>pO</td>
    <td>Backbone carbonyl oxygen atom of the <i>previous</i> residue.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>nN</td>
    <td>Backbone nitrogen atom of the <i>next</i> residue.</td>
  </tr>

<p>Since the number of <i>cis</i>-omega dihedrals (peptide dihedrals) was too
  small to deduce reasonable statistics, the expected values were taken from
  [Jabs&nbsp;1999].</p>
<a id="MethodPhiPsi"></a>
<b><i>&phiv;&minus;&psi;</i>
  Reference Data</b>. The <i>&piv;</i> and <i>&psi;</i> backbone dihedrals are
  correlated; consequently, they are scored using 2-dimensional probability
  distributions calculated on a high-resolution collection of X-ray structures
  containing approximately 100,000 residues from 500 protein structures
  [Lovell&nbsp;2003]. Each probability distribution was estimated with a two
  degree spacing for each of <i>&psi;</i> and <i>&piv;</i> with separate
  histograms for proline, glycine, pre-proline and general amino acids. The
  histograms reveal sharp edges and clear delineation between large empty areas
  and regions that are allowed but disfavored.

<p class="caption">Fig. 5: Contours of Allowed (orange) and Core (green) Regions
  of Ramachandran Maps</p>
<a id="MethodRotamer"></a>
<b>Rotamer Reference
  Data</b>. Quality estimates for a particular protein sidechain are calculated
  based on the backbone-dependent rotamer library published by Dunbrack and
  Cohen [Dunbrack&nbsp;1997]. The rotamer statistics were collected for each
  <i>&phiv;&minus;&psi;</i> combination in 10 degree increments and smoothed
  with Bayesian methods. The backbone dependency of sidechain rotamers is
  restricted to the <i>&chi;</i>1-angle; the remaining <i>&chi;</i> angles are
  independent of the backbone <i>&phiv;&minus;&psi;</i> values. For a given
  backbone <i>&phiv;&minus;&psi;</i> combination, the resulting probabilities
  provide estimates of weakly or strongly populated sidechain rotamers in the
  PDB. The SCWRL strain estimate [Bower&nbsp;1997] is derived from the
  probabilities using <!-- <span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
E_{lib} \left( r_{i} \right) = -K \log \frac{
    p \left( r_{i} / R, \phi, \psi \right)
}{
    p \left( r_{i} = 1 / R, \phi, \psi \right)
}
\end{align}
</span> -->

<img src="progeom/math_progeom_eq0.png" class="center" />

<p>where <i>R</i> is the residue type (ALA, GLU, etc.), and <i>K</i> is a
  constant, set to 3.0 based on optimization of the energy function for a
  180-protein test set. The argument of the log is normalized to the highest
  probability rotamer (defined as <i>r<sub>i</sub></i>=1, so that the energy of
  this rotamer is zero and all others are positive.</p>

<p>The Protein Geometry application uses a different measure of strain
  derived using a statistical mechanical identity: <!-- <span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
E_{i} - E_{avg} = -k T \left( \ln p_{i} - \sum_{i} p_{i} \ln p_{i} \right)
\end{align}
</span> --></p>

<img src="progeom/math_progeom_eq1.png" class="center" />

<p>Here, <i>E<sub>i</sub></i> denotes the energy of Rotamer type <i>i</i>,
  <i>E</i><sub>avg</sub> the average energy of rotamer <i>i</i> assuming a
  Boltzmann distribution, <i>k</i> is the Boltzmann Constant, <i>T</i> the
  temperature (298 K) and <i>p<sub>i</sub></i> is the unit normalized
  probability distribution of rotamer <i>i</i> The rotamer strain energy is
  then <i>E<sub>i</sub></i>&minus;<i>E</i><sub>avg</sub>, which can be
  negative.</p>
<a id="MethodClash"></a>
<b>Calculation of Repulsion
  Energy</b>. The repulsion energy measurement is used to determine van der
  Waals clashes in a macromolecular structure. Each non-hydrogen atom is
  assigned a radius and a van der Waals optimal interaction energy value and a
  distance-dependent function is used to estimate the van der Waals repulsion
  energy between two atoms. The van der Waals radii and well-depth parameters
  are those of the Engh-Huber forcefield [Engh&nbsp;1991] commonly used in
  crystallographic refinement. The distance-dependent interaction function is
  <!-- <span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
w 800 \left( 1 - r/R \right)^{3}
\end{align}
</span> -->

<img src="progeom/math_progeom_eq2.png" class="center" />

<p>where <i>r</i> is the interatomic separation distance, <i>R</i> is the sum
  of the van der Waals radii, and <i>w</i> is the geometric mean of the
  well-depth parameters of the two atoms. Figure 6 compares various functional
  forms for a carbon-carbon interaction: Lennard-Jones 12-6 and 9-6, the 800R3
  function (above) and the SCWRL [Bower&nbsp;1997] function (often used in
  homology modeling).</p>

<img src="progeom/vdwfcn.gif"
alt="Functional forms of vdwEnergy" class="center" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 6: Functional Forms of VDW Interaction Energy.</p>

<p>The 800R3 function lies in between the Lennard-Jones 12-6 and 9-6
  potentials and models only the repulsive part of the van der Waals
  interactions (which is more appropriate in implicit solvent model
  conditions). Close contacts are &quot;capped&quot; to avoid unrealistically
  large energy values.</p>
<a id="MethodACE"></a>
<b>Atomic Contact Energy</b>. The
  calculation of the effective atomic contact energies (ACE) - the desolvation
  free energies required to transfer atoms from water to a protein's
  interior - is based on the publication of Zhang et al. [Zhang&nbsp;1997]. The
  contact desolvation energies are calculated for 18 different atom types of
  the 20 common amino acids that are resolved based on the clustering pattern
  of their properties [Zhang&nbsp;1997]. The contact potentials for each atom
  type are measured within a contact range of 6 Angstroms by explicitly
  accounting for neighboring interactions. The definition of chain neighbors is
  classified in terms of a connectivity matrix <i>Con(i,j)</i>, where <i>i</i>
  and <i>j</i> are the connectivity classes of the contact pair in question:
  <!-- equation does not convert well with pnglatex -->
   <!-- <span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
Con = \left(
    \begin{array}{cccc}
        3 & 3 & 2 & 2 \\\\
        3 & 3 & 3 & 3 \\\\
        4 & 3 & 3 & 3 \\\\
        3 & 3 & 2 & 2
    \end{array}
\right)
\end{align}
</span> -->

<img src="progeom/math_progeom_eq3.png" class="center" />
<p class="caption">Neighbor Connectivity Matrix</p>

<p>where the first index position of the matrix denotes the backbone nitrogen
  atoms, the second the C<i>&alpha;</i> atoms, the third the backbone C atoms,
  and the fourth any of the side-chain atoms. Contact pairs are eliminated from
  the calculation, if any atom of connectivity class <i>i</i> in residue
  <i>k<sub>i</sub></i> and any contact atom in connectivity class <i>j</i> in
  residue <i>k<sub>i</sub></i> (<i>k<sub>j</sub> &ge; k<sub>i</sub></i>)
  satisfy the following condition: <!-- <span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
k_{j} - k_{i} \le Con\left( i,j \right)
\end{align}
</span> --></p>

<img src="progeom/math_progeom_eq4.png" class="center" />

<p>The unscaled pairwise atomic desolvation energies (<i>e<sub>ij</sub></i>)
  are given in units of RT and converted to kcal/mol by a transformation factor
  [Zhang&nbsp;1997].

<a id="Run"></a>
<h1>Running the Application</h1>

<p>The Protein Geometry application can be accessed in the MOE window with
  <nobr><b>MOE | Protein | Geometry</b></nobr> or via the Sequence Editor with
  <nobr><b>SE | Protein | Geometry</b></nobr>. The Protein Geometry application
  is an interface for launching various protein checking routines and can
  conceptually be divided in two sections. The upper section provides means to
  define which residues are included in the calculation, what measurements are
  displayed and whether the display is graphical or textual. The lower section
  is the main results display area.</p>

  </table>

<p>The following sections describe the particular display modes for showing
  results in the Protein Geometry application.</p>

<a id="RunPhiPsi"></a>
<p class="clear-both">
  <img src="progeom/ramplot.png" class="floatright" />
  <b><i>&phiv;&minus;&psi;</i> Plot (Ramachandran)</b>.
  Perhaps the best-known, and certainly most powerful, check for the
  stereochemical quality of a protein is the <i>&phiv;&minus;&psi;</i> Plot
  (Ramachandran Plot).

<p>The 2D data points of <i>&piv;</i> and <i>&psi;</i> backbone torsion
  angles tend to cluster in favorable regions and tend to be excluded from
  certain disallowed regions due to steric hindrance of sidechain atoms.
  Glycine and Proline, which have no sidechains as such, along with amino acids
  preceding Prolines show a different distribution pattern on the map (see
  Methodology above).</p>

<p>The plot combines the four separate Ramachandran maps (as shown to the
  right) using shapes to distinguish the membership to a particular class
  (General, Proline, Glycine and Pre-Proline). Within this scheme, Glycines are
  shown as diamonds, Prolines as triangles, residues preceding Prolines
  (Pre-Proline) have a rectangular shape, otherwise (General case) they are
  drawn as small squares.</p>

<p>The color scheme encodes the affiliation to a certain region within the
  respective Ramachandran Map. Residues in the core region are rendered in
  green or yellow if they are found to be in the allowed region and red if in
  the outlier region. Outliers are always marked as crosses, independent of
  their class.</p>

<p>The <b>Color</b> Option allows for viewing the plot in either black or
  white background color. When <b>White</b> background is selected the above
  mentioned coloring scheme for assignment to core, allowed or outlier region
  within the map is not used; instead filled or non-filled shapes are used to
  make class distinctions.</p>

<img src="progeom/ramlegend.png" class="center" />

<p>The Data mode shows a list of the data used to make the plot. The chain
  name and number, residue name and number are displayed one-per-line. The
  measured <i>&piv;</i> and <i>&psi;</i> values are also listed along with the
  likelihood score of the combination, and an assessment given indicating
  whether the values are allowed or are outliers. The data can be sorted by
  data column by clicking on individual field titles. When <b>Select Atoms</b>
  is pressed, residue atoms in highlighted list lines will be selected in the
  MOE window. The <b>Outliers Only</b> button can be used to restrict the list
  to display outliers only.</p>

<img src="progeom/ramdata.png" class="center" />

<a id="RunLength"></a>
<p class="clear-both">
  <img src="progeom/blengthplot.png" class="floatright" />
  <b>Bond Lengths</b>. The Bond Length plot
  shows the quality of backbone bond lengths on a Z-Score scale (standard
  deviations from expectation) as defined in <a href="#bblen">Figure&nbsp;2</a>
  (above).</p>


<p>The Z-Score profiles are shown in three separate plots. The plot on the
  top depicts the bond lengths centered on the backbone nitrogen (the backbone
  bonds pC-N and N-CA respectively). The plot in the middle displays the bond
  lengths of the backbone C<i>&alpha;</i> atom (bonds with backbone C and CB
  respectively). The plot on the bottom depicts the bond lengths of the
  backbone C atom with C<i>&alpha;</i> and backbone oxygen.</p>

<p>The X-axis of these plots shows the residues in sequential order within
  MOE; the Y-axis is the Z-Scores of the particular backbone bond length. A
  Z-Score cutoff of 4.0 is marked by the dotted horizontal line colored in dark
  red. Residues with values above this cutoff should be seen as outliers.
  Residues that are selected in the MOE Window are drawn as circles and can be
  selected interactively in the plots. In order to facilitate standardized
  viewing the Z-Score values are clamped to 5.5.</p>

<p>The <b>Color</b> Option allows for viewing the plots with either a black
  or white background. Press the <b>Definitions</b> button to raise a window
  with the backbone definitions and expected values as shown in <a href=
  "#bblen">Figure&nbsp;2</a>.</p>

<p>The bond length data can also be viewed in a tabular list when the
  <b>Display</b> is set to Data. In this mode, the values of the various bond
  data and Z-Scores are displayed. The data can be sorted by data column by
  clicking on individual field titles. This feature might be helpful in finding
  data subsets of interest. The corresponding residue atoms of selected entries
  in the list may also be selected in the MOE Window by pressing the <b>Select
  Atoms</b> Button. Outliers - entries with Z-Score values larger than a given
  Z-Score cutoff - can easily be identified by checking <b>Outliers Only</b>.
  By default, the Z-Score cutoff is set to 4.0 but may be set to a desired
  value specified in the <b>Z-Score Threshold</b> field.</p>

<img src="progeom/blengthdata.png" class="center" />


<a id="RunAngle"></a>
<p class="clear-both">
  <img src="progeom/angleplot.png" class="floatright" />
  <b>Bond Angles</b>. The Bond Angle plot shows the quality
  of backbone bond angles on a Z-Score scale (standard deviations from
  expectation) as defined in <a href="#bbang">Figure&nbsp;3</a> (above).</p>

<p>The Z-Score profiles are shown in three separate plots. The plot on the
  top depicts the bond angles centered on the backbone nitrogen (the backbone
  bonds pCA-pC-N and pC-N-CA respectively). The plot in the middle displays the
  bond angles of the backbone C<i>&alpha;</i> atom (N-CA-C and N-CA-CB
  respectively). The plot on the bottom depicts the bond angles of the backbone
  C atom with C<i>&alpha;</i> and backbone oxygen as well as with nitrogen and
  C<i>&alpha;</i> (CA-C=O and N-CA-CB respectively).</p>

<p>The X-axis of these plots shows the residues in sequential order within
  MOE; the Y-axis is the Z-Scores of the particular backbone bond angle. A
  Z-Score cutoff of 4.0 is marked by the dotted horizontal line colored in dark
  red. Residues with values above this cutoff should be seen as outliers.
  Residues that are selected in the MOE Window are drawn as circles and can be
  selected interactively in the plots. In order to facilitate standardized
  viewing the Z-Score values are clamped to 5.5.</p>

<p>The <b>Color</b> Option allows for viewing the plots with either a black
  or white background. Press the <b>Definitions</b> button to raise a window
  with the backbone definitions and expected values as shown in
  Figure&nbsp;3.</p>

<p>The backbone angle data can also be viewed in a tabular list when the
  <b>Display</b> is set to Data. In this mode, the values of the various bond
  angles and Z-Scores are displayed. The data can be sorted by data column by
  clicking on individual field titles. This feature might be helpful in finding
  data subsets of interest. The corresponding residue atoms of selected entries
  in the list may also be selected in the MOE Window by pressing the <b>Select
  Atoms</b> Button. Outliers - entries with Z-Score values larger than a given
  Z-Score cutoff - can easily be identified by checking <b>Outliers Only</b>.
  By default, the Z-Score cutoff is set to 4.0 but may be set to a desired
  value specified in the <b>Z-Score Threshold</b> field.</p>

<img src="progeom/angledata.png" class="center" />


<a id="RunDihedral"></a>
<p class="clear-both">
    <img src="progeom/dihedralplot.png" class="floatright" />
    <b>Dihedrals</b>. The Dihedral plot shows
  the quality of backbone torsion angles on a Z-Score scale (standard
  deviations from expectation) as defined in <a href="#bbdih">Figure&nbsp;4</a>
  (above).</p>

<p>As already seen with the bond length and angle plots, the Z-Score profiles
  are shown in three separate plots. The plot on the top depicts the profile of
  the omega torsion as defined in Figure 4 in the Methodology section above.
  The plot in the middle shows the planarity and <i>&phi; / &psi;</i> profiles,
  and the one on the bottom the profile of the C<i>&beta;</i> torsion angle. It
  is worth noting that the calculations of the <i>&piv;</i> and <i>&psi;</i>
  profiles depend upon each other and are not separate. As a result, the
  profiles of <i>&piv;</i> and <i>&psi;</i> are identical.</p>

<p>The X-axis of these plots shows the residues in sequential order within
  MOE; the Y-axis is the Z-Scores of the respective backbone dihedral. A
  Z-Score cutoff of 4.0 is marked by the dotted horizontal line colored in dark
  red. Residues with values above this cutoff should be seen as outliers.
  Residues that are selected in the MOE Window are drawn as circles and can be
  selected interactively in the plots. In order to facilitate standardized
  viewing the Z-Score values are clamped to 5.5.</p>

<p>The <b>Color</b> Option allows for viewing the plots with either a black
  or white background. Press the <b>Definitions</b> button to raise a window
  with the backbone definitions and expected values as shown in
  Figure&nbsp;4.</p>

<p>The backbone dihedral data can also be viewed in a tabular list when the
  <b>Display</b> is set to Data. In this mode, the values of the various
  torsion angles and Z-Scores are displayed. The data can be sorted by data
  column by clicking on individual field titles. This feature might be helpful
  in finding data subsets of interest. The corresponding residue atoms of
  selected entries in the list may also be selected in the MOE Window by
  pressing the <b>Select Atoms</b> Button. The collection of dihedral data can
  be selected using the checkboxes in <b>Torsions</b>. Outliers - entries with
  Z-Score values larger than a given Z-Score cutoff - can easily be identified
  by checking <b>Outliers Only</b>. By default, the Z-Score cutoff is set to
  4.0 but may be set to a desired value specified in the <b>Z-Score
  Threshold</b> field.</p>

  <b>Rotamer</b>. The Plot depicts the rotamer
  strain energy (kcal/mol) calculated as outlined in the Methodology section
  above. The X-Axis shows the residues in sequential order within MOE. Residues
  with strain energies larger than 5.0 kcal/mol (marked by the dotted
  horizontal line in dark red color) are infrequent in the PDB and warrant a
  closer inspection. The strain energy threshold of the result set may be
  adjusted with the <b>E-Threshold</b> slider reducing the results to entries
  with strain energies above the designated cutoff. The <b>Color</b> option
  allows for setting the background color either to black or white.</p>

<p>The rotamer data can be viewed in a table when the <b>Display</b> option
  is set to <b>Data</b>. The Residues are labeled by affiliation to chains and
  by ID field number in the PDB files. For each rotamer, the backbone
  <i>&piv;</i> and <i>&psi;</i> angles and their respective side chain torsions
  (<i>&chi;</i> angles) are listed as well as the rotamer strain energy
  (kcal/mol) and probability factor as obtained from the rotamer library. The
  results can be sorted by each of these categories by clicking on the field
  titles. Pressing the <b>Select Atoms</b> button facilitates the selection of
  the corresponding atoms in the MOE Window as selected in the table. The
  cutoff for rotamer strain energy is adjustable by moving the
  <b>E-Threshold</b> slider. As with the Plot, only entries with strain
  energies above the designated value will then be listed.</p>

<p><img src="progeom/rotamerdata.png" class="center" />

<a id="RunClashes"></a>
<p class="clear-both"><b>Atom Clashes</b>. The clashing
  of two non-bonded atoms is defined by a positive repulsion energy term (in
  kcal/mol) as outlined in Methodology (above). In <b>Plot</b> viewing mode,
  the sum of the repulsion energies for each residue's atoms is plotted on
  the Y axis in kcal/mol. The X-Axis shows the residues in sequential order
  within MOE. The <b>Options</b> control which interactions are included in the
  calculations:</p>

<table class="noborder">
  <tr>
    <th>Include Hydrogens</th>
    <td>If on, clashes involving hydrogen atoms are included</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Ignore Hydrogen Bonds</th>
    <td>If on, clashes of potential H-Bond partners are discarded</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Within Chains only</th>
    <td>If on, the search space for clashing partners is confined to atoms
    that are members of the same chain</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<img src="progeom/clashplot.png" alt="Atom Clashes Plot" class="center" />

<p>The sensitivity for an atom clash can be adjusted by the
  <b>E-Threshold</b> slider and is set to 0.5 kcal/mol by default. Contact
  pairs with repulsion energies lower than this value will then be discarded
  from the result set.</p>

<p>The Plot can also be viewed with either a white or black background as
  specified in <b>Color</b>.</p>

<p>If <b>Display</b> is set to Data, information about each clashing pair is
  displayed in a table. The respective clashing atoms are specified by chain
  name, residue name, residue ID number in the PDB files and atom name and are
  listed together with the distance between their respective atom centers
  (in&nbsp;&Aring;) and the repulsion energy (in kcal/mol). As for the Plot
  display, the <b>Options</b> define the interactions included in the atom
  clash analysis. Clicking on individual field titles allows the data to be
  sorted, for example by the residue name of either of the clashing atoms, the
  clash distance or the repulsion energy. The sensitivity of the atom clash is
  set to 0.5 kcal/mol by default and may be adjusted by moving the
  <b>E-Threshold</b> slider resulting in elimination of entries with repulsion
  energies lower than the designated cutoff value.</p>

<p>The <b>Action</b> buttons are activated when list entries are selected.
  When selected in the entry list, clashing atoms can be selected in the MOE
  Window by pressing the <b>Select Atoms</b> button. All atoms of a residue
  containing a clashing atom can be selected by pressing <b>Select
  Residues</b>. Pressing the <b>Isolate Selected</b> button changes the viewing
  mode of the MOE Window altogether. In this mode, only the residues of the
  clashing atoms will be shown in the MOE Window along with the distance
  between the clashing atoms, which are displayed as balls. This procedure
  facilitates inspection of the clashing partners as listed in the table. The
  previous settings in the MOE Window can be restored by pressing <b>Reset
  View</b>.</p>

<a id="RunACE"></a>
<p class="clear-both">
  <img src="progeom/aceplot.png" class="floatright" />
  <b>Contact Energies</b>. The effective atomic contact energies
  (ACE) are calculated for heavy atoms of standard amino acids within a contact
  range of 6 &Aring;, assigning energy terms (in kcal/mol) for each contact
  pair as outlined in Methodology (above). These energies are summed for each
  residue in the system. In general, a large negative value indicates that the
  residue is predominantly in contact with hydrophobic atoms and therefore
  expected to be in a buried protein environment. Residues with positive energy
  terms indicate contacts with predominantly hydrophilic atoms, and so are
  expected to be in more solvent-exposed regions of the protein. In <b>Plot</b>
  viewing mode, the contact energies in kcal/mol are shown on the Y-Axis, while
  the position of the residue within the MOE system is shown on the X-Axis.
  Residues containing selected atoms in the MOE Window are drawn as circles,
  and can be selected interactively in the plot.</p>

<p>The Plot can also be viewed with either a white or black background as
  specified in <b>Color</b>.</p>

<p>In Data viewing mode (<b>Display</b> is set to Data) the contact energies
  of each residue is displayed in a table specified by chain name, residue
  name, residue UID number and energy value (kcal/mol). Atoms of selected
  residues in the list can be selected by pressing <b>Select Atoms</b>. Data in
  the table may be sorted by clicking on the field titles.</p>

  <a id="Report"><b>Report</b></a>
  The results of the stereochemical measurements
  in the Protein Geometry application may be summarized in a report by pressing
  the <b>Report</b> button. The required topics can be chosen using the
  checkboxes, and cutoff-values set each of the topics, except Ramachandran
  Plot. For the report, these cutoffs may be set to different values.</p>

<p><b>Data Set</b> controls what data from each topic is included in the
  report. Selecting <b>all</b> will write all the data, whereas if
  <b>exceptions</b> is selected only the outliers of the respective topics will
  be written. If <b>Display</b> in the Protein Geometry Application is set to
  Data, an additional option, <b>listed data</b>, is presented. If this is
  used, the report will only contain the data currently shown in the Protein
  Geometry application. The content of the report is shown in the SVL Text
  Editor, as shown below in an excerpt from a report file.</p>

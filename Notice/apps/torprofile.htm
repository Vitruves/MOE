<p>
Reducing internal strain energy in small molecules is critical for designing
potent drugs [Sellers&nbsp;2017].  A torsion energy analysis, or
Torsion Profile, estimates the
strain energy for a 360&deg; rotation around a single rotatable bond.  This
identifies the minimum-energy orientations as well as the rotation barrier(s)
to their interconversion.  This can be used by medicinal chemists to
determine the optimal conformation of compounds under consideration.
[Muegge&nbsp;2016].
Torsion profiles can also be used to determine or improve
forcefield parameters [Kahn&nbsp;2002] particularly when experimental
structural information is lacking.
</p>

<p>
An approximate profile can be rapidly determined
by rotating a portion of the structure as a rigid body and calculating
the energy at each
angle.  A more detailed profile can be obtained by constraining the torsion
angle
of the rotating bond and allowing the rest of the structure to relax yielding
minimized energies.  All calculations can be performed using forcefield or
quantum chemical (QM) methods, with the latter requiring greater compute
resources
while providing a means of investigating structural details not amenable to
classical modeling.
</p>


<!-- ============================= METHODOLOGY -=========================== -->

<a id="Method"></a>
<h1>Methodology</h1>

<p>
The Torsion Profile application performs a series of operations (described
below) on behalf
of the user in order to create a profile of a rotating bond.  Two
types of profiles can be generated: a rigid-body rotation can be performed,
calculating the energy at each rotation angle:

<img src="torprofile/fixedpix.png" alt="Rigid-body Profile" class="center" />

This is a rapid calculation as no minimizations are performed, although it
can yield arbitrarily large energy values when the rotating bond is
sterically hindered.
</p>

<p>
A better approximation of the dynamic nature of the rotating bond can be
obtained by performing a constrained minimization for each torsion angle
value of the scan.  This allows all atoms to relax as long as the required
torsion angle value is maintained, yielding more realistic energy profiles:

<img src="torprofile/movedpix.png" alt="Constrained min Profile" class="center" />

As shown, the non-rotating phenyl ring can change its orientation to
reduce steric clash due to proximity of the rotating portion of the structure.
The rotating bond in selected in both examples.
</p>

<h2>Rigid-rotor Torsion Profiles</h2>

<p>
This option mirrors the
<a href="../moe/gui/mainwin.htm#DihedralProfile">Interactive Energy Profile</a>
that can be calculated via the bottom bar in MOE.  The moving portion of
the structure is rotated to each desired torsion angle value and the energy
calculated via the
<a href="../moe/fcnref/potfcn.htm">Potential</a> function (using the
current forcefield and settings).  It is included in all calculations so
that the user can easily visualize the effect of constrained minimization.
</p>

<h2>Constrained Minimization Torsion Profiles</h2>

<p>
This option performs single- or bi-directional scans using the current
forcefield and settings.  This is a multi-step process:

<ol>
  <li>
  <p>Determine the torsion angle values that must be examined.  All forcefield
  calculations are performed with a one-degree stepsize, modified to include
  all user-specified angles.  For example, if the (default) 7.5&deg; stepsize
  is used, the non-whole-number angles must be included:
  <tt>5, 6, 7, 7.5, 8, ...</tt>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>If requested, perform the clockwise scan.  Starting from the torsion angle
  value from (1) that is closest to the input structure, a series of
  constrained minimizations are performed to generate the structures and
  energies for each desired angle.  A two-step process is used:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
    Apply a tether to each atom to restrain it to its starting position and
    minimize.  This reduces steric clashes while preserving the initial
    geometry.
    </li>
    <li>
    Remove the tethers and minimize again.  This fully relaxes the geometry,
    generating the forcefield-based structure and energy for each constrained
    angle.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>All calculations use the results of the previous angle as their initial
  geometries.  As the maximum internal angle stepsize is one degree,
  geometry changes
  for each minimization step will be reduced.  However, sterically-hindered
  bonds can (or will) be dependent on the rotation direction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>If requested, perform the counterclockwise scan.  The process described
  in (2) is performed in the opposite direction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>If a bi-directional profile is requested, the results of the clockwise-
  and counter-clockwise scans are compared and the lower-energy value
  (and structure) for each user-specified angle are recorded.  If structures
  and energies based on QM calculations are requested, the
  lower-energy structure from each tethered minimization is recorded as well.
  These will be used as the input structures for the QM calculations.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Conformer-based Torsion Profiles</h2>

<p>
A bi-directional scan provides an approximation of the Torsion Profile for
a sterically-hindered bond.  A better approximation can be obtained by
using a conformer database as input rather than a single structure, as
the clash might not be present in higher-energy conformers due to internal
rotation:</p>

<ul>
<li>
For each input conformer, perform a bi-directional scan as described
above.  If MOE is running in MPU mode (described in the
<a href="../install/smp_inst.htm">MOE/smp manual</a>),
each calculation scan will be performed simultaneously.
</li>
<br />
<li>
The results of the bi-directional scans for each conformer are compared,
and the lowest-energy value (and structure) for each user-specified angle
are recorded.  The structures from tethered minimization will be used
as the input for any QM calculations while the fully-minimized
structures (and associated energies) provide the forcefield-based
Torsion Profile.
</ul>

<p>As all calculations are done using the current forcefield and settings,
conformer-based Torsion Profiles will not require significantly more
time to complete (particularly if MPU is available).  The output database
indicates which conformer yielded the structure associated with each
user-specified torsion angle in the field <b>ConformerFF</b>.
</p>

<h2>QM-based Torsion Profiles</h2>

<p>
Torsion Profiles can be obtained with any QM Engine that is capable of
performing constrained minimization (currently, this is limited to
Gaussian or GAMESS).  Rather than performing QM-based scanning, the results
from the forcefield calculations described above (either from rigid-rotor
or tethered minimization) are used as the initial geometries for a series
of independent calculations.  If MOE is running in MPU mode, these will
be performed simultaneously.  The calculations can also be run outside
of MOE if desired.
</p>

<p>
QM-based Torsion Profiles can accurately reflect features, such as 1-5
interactions or halogen H-bonds [Jorgensen 2012], that are not well-modeled
with forcefield methods.  The
resulting energies can be more precise, as they are less sensitive to
the quality and extent of the forcefield's parameter set and/or the
presence of correction terms.  Using the
results of the forcefield calculation also reduces the risk of structural
rearrangement, as steric hindrance is resolved before the QM calculation
starts.  However, novel or highly-strained structures might require
a smaller torsion angle stepsize to provide better initial geometries.

The second calculation reveals that the minimum-energy value of the AM1
Torsion Profile occurs at 0&deg; and the overall shape of the AM1 profile
changes due to the different minimum-energy value.
The 0&deg; structure has a Heat of Formation of <tt>-80.62</tt>,
which is noticeably lower than that of the artifact, <tt>-74.17</tt>.
Looking at the various values in the <tt>EQM</tt> column reveals that
the energies of the second calculation are the same or lower than those
of the first, showing that the perturbation did not negatively affect
the calculation.
</p>

<p>
Browsing the <tt>molQM</tt> column reveals that the minimum-energy structure
has the <tt>COO<sup>-</sup></tt> group planar to the rings with an
<tt>S...O</tt> distance of 2.09&Aring;.  This reveals that the forcefield
calculation is unable to account for the 1-5 interaction between sulfur and
oxygen, and the <span class="nobr"><b>Modify Angles</b></span> perturbation
was necessary to "break the symmetry" enabling the AM1 constrained minimization
to rotate the <tt>COO<sup>-</sup></tt> group.  Similar energy curves are
expected for higher-level QM calculations, such as that for a 7.5&deg;
<tt>B3LYP/6-31G*</tt> calculation:

class="center" />

A 5&deg; <b>Modify Angles</b> perturbation was used to reduce the artifacts
at +/- 180&deg; and 0&deg;.  In this calculation, the minimum-energy
torsion angles are roughly +/- 35&deg;.

<ol>
<li>
<p><i>Create a test structure.</i></p>

<p>First, clear the system:</p>

<p class="indent_novspace"><span class="menu">RHS | Close</span></p>

<p>then open the Builder:</p>
<p class="indent_novspace"><span class="menu">
RHS | Builder</span></p>
<p> Type "N(CCc1ccccc1)Cc1ccccc1" into the SMILES field, and press the
  <img src="torprofile/smile.png" class="icon" />  button.</p>

<p>Minimize the sketched structure:</p>

<p class="indent_novspace"><span class="menu">RHS | Minimize</span></p>

<p>Specify the rotatable bond by selecting the four atoms of the chain
linking the aromatic rings.  This will be used to define the Inner layer
for ONIOM.  The display should look like this:</p>

<img src="torprofile/ONIOMStruct.png" alt="Minimized ONIOM structure ex3"
class="center" />
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Run Torsion Profile</i></p>

<p class="indent_novspace">
<span class="menu">MOE | Compute | Conformations | Torsion Profile</span>
</p>

<p>Select the Configure icon for the <b>Profile</b> entry, and change
the stepsize from <tt>7.5</tt> to <tt>30</tt>.  Press <b>OK</b> to
accept the changes.  Select
<span class="nobr"><b>QM Minimization</b></span> and press its Configure
icon.</p>

<p>To set up the ONIOM calculation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select <b>ONIOM</b> to signal an ONIOM (multi-layer) calculation.</li>
<li>Enter <tt>asel</tt> in the <b>Inner</b> layer selection box.</li>
<li>Enter <tt>0</tt> in the <b>Middle</b> layer extend-radius box.</li>
<li>Press the Configure icon for the Inner layer and choose <b>HF</b> as
the <b>Method</b> and <b>STO-3G</b> as the basis set.  Press <b>OK</b>
to accept the selection.</li>
<li>Press the Configure icon for the <b>Outer</b> layer and choose <b>MM</b>
as the <b>Method</b>.  This will use the current forcefield parameters and
partial charges from MOE for the forcefield portion of the ONIOM
calculation.</li>
<li>Make sure only <span class="nobr"><b>Geometry Optimization</b></span>
and <span class="nobr"><b>Multi-step Convergence</b></span> options are
selected.  If desired, the <b>Keywords</b> <tt>%nproc=2 %mem=2gb</tt> can
be entered to specify two cores for the calculation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The configuration panel should look like this:

<img src="torprofile/ONIOMPanel.png" alt="ONIOM panel ex3"
class="center" />

and the MOE system should highlight the Inner layer:

<img src="torprofile/ONIOMStruct2.png" alt="ONIOM Inner layer ex3"
class="center" />
</ol>

Press <b>OK</b> to start the calculation.  It will take roughly 5-15 minutes
and creates <tt>torsionprofile.mdb</tt> and the following Torsion Profile:

<img src="torprofile/ONIOM_STO3G.png" alt="ONIOM output plot ex3"
class="center" />

</p>

<p> While this is a trivial example, ONIOM provides a means of
investigating systems with complex side chains that are not proximate to
the torsion being profiled but are too important to remove from the
calculation.  In addition, it would allow for torsions 
involving unusual bonding or elements to be analyzed without requiring
a fully-QM treatment.</p>

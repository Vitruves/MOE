<p>The purpose of Conformation Import is to rapidly calculate low-energy
  conformations of molecules contained in MDL SD files, CSV files containing
  SMILES, or MOE Molecular Databases.  When run on a
  <a href= "../install/smp_inst.htm">MOE/cluster (MOE/smp)</a>
  multi-processor, Conformation Import will automatically execute in parallel.
  The main characteristics of Conformation Import are:
</p>
<ol>
  <li><i>High Throughput</i>. The protocol is designed for generating
  conformations for large collections of molecules.</li>
  <li><i>Forcefield-Based</i>. A forcefield is used as the basis for
  determining low energy conformations (as opposed to rule-based
  methods).</li>
  <li><i>Fragment Approach</i>. Molecules are divided into overlapping
  fragments whose conformations are determined independently.</li>
</ol>

<p>In this document we present an overview of the underlying methodology as
  well as instructions on how to run the application.</p>

<!-- METHODOLOGY -->
<a id="Methodology"></a>
<h1>Methodology Overview</h1>

<p>Conformation Import calculates low energy conformations of a collection of
  molecules. The processing of these molecules (typically in SDF or MDB files)
  proceeds in stages.  The main stages of the calculation are as follows:</p>

  <img src="confgui/method.png" class="floatright"
	alt="Conformation Import Method" />

<p><b>Wash and Filter</b>. Acids and bases are (de)protonated and a single
  molecular component is retained.  A Descriptor Filter can be used to
  reject compounds with undesirable properties; typically, size and flexibility
  are restricted (e.g. eliminate large or overly flexible compounds).  Any
  <a href= "../quasar/descr.htm">2D QuaSAR descriptor</a> can be used.</p>

<p><b>Fragment</b>.  Input molecules are divided into overlapping fragments.
  The idea is to fragment the molecules so that each fragment's conformations
  can be determined independently.</p>

<p><b>Lookup or Search</b>.  Fragment conformations are saved during the
  calculations for re-use in different molecules.  New fragments are subjected
  to a full conformational search to generate the conformations and then are
  saved.  Constraints (e.g. <i>trans</i> amides and esters) are imposed on
  the conformations to prevent high-energy group conformations. A fragment
  strain energy limit of 4.0 kcal/mol and a RMSD tolerance of 0.25 &Aring;
  is enforced.</p>

<p><b>Assemble</b>.  Rigid-body superpositions (on the intersections of the
  fragments) are used to assemble fragment conformations into full molecular
  conformations.  Van der Waals clashes are relieved with energy minimization.
  Topological symmetries are used to eliminate duplicates.</p>

<p>At the lowest level, a stochastic conformational search method is used
  to generate fragment conformations.  Stochastic search is a simple, reliable,
  and efficient method to search chain, ring, and stereochemistry
  configurations.</p>

<div class="indent">
  <p><b>Step 1</b> [Initialize].  Initialize the conformation list <i>C</i>
      to empty. Set the failure counter <i>f</i> to zero.

  <p><b>Step 2</b> [Embed].  Obtain a set of 3D coordinates (ignoring chiral
      constraints) using a distance geometry algorithm (see below).</p>

  <p><b>Step 3</b> [Perturb]. Randomly rotate all bonds (including ring bonds)
      and randomly invert all chiral centers and non-planar atoms with three
      or more heavy neighbors.</p>

  <p><b>Step 4</b> [Minimize].  Energy minimize the resulting set of
      coordinates.</p>

  <p><b>Step 5</b> [Reject].  If the conformation fails any one of several
      quality checks or has previously been seen in the list <i>C</i>, it
      is rejected.  If the conformation is rejected, then increase the failure
      counter <i>f</i> by one.  If the failure limit <i>f</i> exceeds a
      preset limit, then go to Step&nbsp;7; otherwise return to Step&nbsp;3.</p>

  <p><b>Step 6</b> [Save].  Add the coordinates of the atoms and the potential
      energy of the coordinates to the conformation list <i>C</i>. Set the
      failure counter, <i>f</i>, to zero. Return to Step&nbsp;3.</p>

  <p><b>Step 7</b> [Termination].  Save the conformation list <i>C</i> and
      terminate the algorithm.</p>
</div>

<p>The termination criteria in Step&nbsp;5 can be interpreted as follows.
  Upon termination there have been <i>f</i> consecutive attempts to generate
  a new configuration and each has failed.  By way of analogy to coin tossing,
  we can estimate the probability that there exists a configuration not yet
  seen.  Using the coin tossing analogy, a biased coin has been tossed L times
  and each time &quot;heads&quot; was observed. The Bayes estimate for the
  probability of observing &quot;heads&quot; is (#heads+1)/(#tosses+2). If
  L &quot;heads&quot; are observed in L tosses then the probability of
  observing &quot;heads&quot; is (L+1)/(L+2); thus the probability of
  observing &quot;tails&quot; (or, analogously, a new configuration) is
  1/(L+2). At L = 18 this probability is 5%.</p>

<p>Step&nbsp;3 of the algorithm computes an initial set of 3D coordinates of
  a molecule when given a molecular graph.  Chiral constraints are ignored for
  the embedding since chirality is part of the StochasticSearch algorithm. The
  Embed3D algorithm is used to effect the embedding:</p>

  <div class="indent">
<p><b>Step 1</b>. Calculate two <i>n</i> by <i>n</i> matrices L and U, the
    estimate of lower and upper the bounds of the inter-atomic distances; that
    is, for atoms <i>i</i> and <i>j</i>, we estimate L<i><sub>ij</sub></i> and
    U<i><sub>ij</sub></i> such that in any conformation, the distance
    <i>d</i> between atoms <i>i</i> and <i>j</i> satisfies
    L<i><sub>ij</sub></i> &lt; <i>d</i> &lt; U<i><sub>ij</sub></i>.</p>

<p><b>Step 2</b>. Calculate a random inter-atomic distance matrix D such
    that D<i><sub>ji</sub></i> = D<i><sub>ij</sub></i> = L<i><sub>ij</sub></i>
    + X<i><sub>ij</sub></i> where <i>i</i>&lt;<i>j</i> and
    X<i><sub>ij</sub></i> is a random number chosen uniformly in the interval
    [L<i><sub>ij</sub></i>,U<i><sub>ij</sub></i>].</p>

<p><b>Step 3</b>. Obtain an initial set of coordinates using the
    least-squares linear embedding method. Briefly, assuming that D is the
    distance matrix of a set of points, a dot product matrix A is derived
    from D (A<i><sub>ij</sub></i> is the dot product of the coordinate vectors
    of points <i>i</i> and <i>j</i>, assuming the points' centroid is at the
    origin). A is then diagonalized and the first three eigenvectors scaled by
    the square root of the associated eigenvalues are retained as the
    coordinate estimates.</p>

<p><b>Step 4</b>. Energy minimize the coordinates obtained in Step&nbsp;3.
    If the resulting conformation passes quality checks described above, then
    the algorithm terminates; otherwise go to Step&nbsp;2.</p>
</div>

<p>In practice, Embed3D is fast (especially for molecular fragments) and only
  one or two iterations of the algorithm are required (even for bridge systems
  and fused ring systems).</p>

<p>To summarize, Conformation Import uses a method based upon stochastic
  search of fragments followed by the assembly of fragment conformations to
  produce molecular conformations unique up to rigid-body superposition and
  molecular symmetry. For speed, a fragment database is used to store (for
  re-use) the calculated fragment conformations.

<!-- OUTPUT -->
<a id="Output"></a>
<h1>Output</h1>

<p>The Output Conformation Database is specified in the
  <b>Output&nbsp;Database</b> field. Conformations will be written in
  <a href="../mdb/dbio.htm#MDB">packed format</a> to the
  specified database which will be created at the start of calculation. This
  database can become very large, so it is recommended to split the output
  database (default).</p>

<p> In all cases, it is advisable to verify that appropriate
  disk space is available.  Note that running on a <a href=
  "../install/smp_inst.htm">MOE/cluster (MOE/smp)</a> multi-processor has no
  effect on the number of output conformation databases produced.</p>

<p>The fields in the Output Conformation Database have the following

    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>

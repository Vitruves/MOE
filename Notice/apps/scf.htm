<h1>Background</h1>
</a>

<p>There are two main categories of algorithms for describing molecular
  properties as a function of constituent atoms and their connectivity and
  Cartesian coordinates. The simpler of the two is the classical forcefield
  method, in which the <span class="nobr"><q>ball &amp; spring</q></span>
  metaphor is applied to atoms and bonds, using parameters trained to reproduce
  quantitative data. The calculation of potential energy and gradients is
  computationally efficient, allowing discovery of minimum energy geometries of
  huge molecular species such as proteins.</p>

<p>The other main category includes quantum chemical (wavefunction-based)
  methods, which begin by ascribing to each atom a set of atomic orbitals,
  described by basis functions, and some number of electrons to populate them.
  The shapes of the orbitals defined by the chosen basis set are obtained by
  various means, such as exact solutions to the Schr&ouml;dinger equation for a
  single electron, or higher-level fitting to eventual observables.</p>

<p>Wavefunction-based methods operate by constructing an initial guess
  density matrix, in terms of the atomic orbital basis functions, then
  iteratively refining it using the self-consistent field (SCF) technique. At
  each step, the kinetic energy, nuclear attraction and electron-electron
  repulsion terms are accounted for, and a correction applied to the density
  until self-consistency is achieved.</p>

<p>While approaches to solving the SCF equation vary in terms of the
  approximations which are used to achieve a realistic answer within a
  reasonable time, all methods have a common set of variables: total energy,
  molecular orbital eigenvalues and eigenvectors, density matrix and basis
  functions. The principal differences are the mathematical forms chosen to
  describe the basis functions, the means of calculating or approximating the
  electron-electron repulsion integrals, recovery of correlation energy,
  calculation of gradients for geometry optimization, and a number of other
  issues which affect accuracy, speed and reliability. These issues aside, the
  large number of wavefunction-based calculation programs share significant
  overlap in terms of input data, output data and feature set.</p>

<p>Compared to the use of forcefields, calculation of molecular properties
  using wavefunction-based methods is computationally intensive, and the
  necessary compromises increase steeply with molecular size. Methods for
  extending the reach of such calculations involve a combination of time-saving
  approximations which may be circumstantially reasonable, improvements in the
  algorithms of the rate-limiting steps, and harnessing increasing computing
  power.
</p>

<a id="Framework">
<h1>Framework</h1>
</a>

<p>MOE provides a framework for making use of quantum chemistry calculations
  which operate by producing a wavefunction using the self-consistent field
  (SCF) method. The SCF features in MOE consist of panels for setting up
  calculations and viewing their results, SVL functions for programmatic
  control, a plug-in mechanism for adding interfaces to new packages, and a
  file format which uniformly spans all supported packages.</p>

<p>An external application that has been interfaced to the MOE SCF framework
  is referred to as an <i>QM engine</i>. Each such engine is incorporated into
  the MOE SCF framework via a single SVL function which controls access to its
  feature set. To be useful, an QM engine must be able to operate on a
  collection of atoms with starting coordinates (such as can be derived from
  the MOE Window), and should output data such as total energy, eigenvalues,
  basis functions and the wavefunction. Most QM engines provide structure
  optimization capabilities, and a variety of calculated properties.</p>

<p>The SCF framework and the SVL interface functions handle all the supported
  commonality between the QM engines. The functionality exposed by any
  particular QM engine can be accessed from a common user interface in MOE,
  and the same set of functions in SVL. The data obtained by performing a
  calculation is stored in a consistent format, and can be used in the same way
  regardless of which package was used to generate it.</p>

<p>In addition to recording properties which were calculated by a particular
  QM engine, the SCF framework also has capabilities for calculating
  properties which are derived from the wavefunction, including 3D plots of the
  electron density and individual molecular orbitals.
</p>

<a id="Panels">
<h1>Single Structure</h1>
</a>

<p>The following sections describe the main user interface elements which
  make the SCF Wavefunction capabilities available, using the contents of the
  MOE main window as the structural template.
</p>

<a id="Setup">
<h2>Setup</h2>
</a>

<p>A new SCF calculation can be started by selecting the <nobr><b>MOE |
  Compute | Simulations | SCF Calculation</b></nobr> menu option. The
  <span class="nobr"><b>SCF Calculation</b></span> panel will be shown.</p>

<img src="scf/setup1.png" alt="Default MOPAC panel" class="center" />

<p>
This shows that the <tt>MOPAC</tt> engine is selected and that its default
options have not been changed. The following configuration options are
supported. The availability and choices for these options depend on the QM
engine:
</p>

<table class="noborder">
<tr>
<th style="text-align:left; vertical-align:top">Wavefunction</th>
<td style="padding: 0.5em;">If specified, the results of the calculation
will be saved in the Wavefunction file upon completion. The filename can
be specified by entering it into the text field or by pressing
<b>Browse...</b> and selecting the appropriate file. The user has the
option of creating a Wavefunction file from the <span class="nobr"><b>SCF
Results</b></span> panel. Wavefunction files should have the suffix
<tt>.wfn</tt>.<br />
<br />
All files for the QM calculation are written in the execution directory.
This is constructed using the name of the Wavefunction as a prefix,
combined with a constant to make it unique. If the Wavefunction file is
omitted, the calculation uses the value of the <tt>TMP</tt>
constant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:left; vertical-align:top">Selected&nbsp;Atoms
Only</th>
<td style="padding: 0.5em;">If on, all atoms of the connected
component(s) containing selected atoms will be used in the
calculation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:left; vertical-align:top">Verbose&nbsp;Output</th>
<td style="padding: 0.5em;">If on, additional information is written to
the SVL Commands window as the calculation proceeds.</td>
</tr>
</table>

All of the remaining options are described in the <span class="nobr">
<a href="qmconfig.htm#QMCalcOptions">QM Calculation Options</a></span>
panel.

<p>To start the calculation, press the <b>Run</b> button. The panel will
  close, and a status indication will be shown in the MOE Window. The level of
  detail of the progress report depends on the engine. If a Wavefunction file
  has been specified in the <b>Filename</b> field, and a file of that name
  already exists, a prompt requesting confirmation for overwrite will
  appear.</p>

<p>If the calculation is a new one, it will use the atoms from the MOE main
  window as the molecular structure starting point. If the calculation is being
  continued, the already-extant molecular structure will be used, with atomic
  coordinates as-determined at the end of the previous calculation.</p>

<p>Pressing the <b>Load</b> button instructs the SCF framework to try and
  process the output file(s) from the current QM engine. It brings up a file
  browser and the user can select the appropriate output file. If, for example,
  the <tt>Gaussian</tt> engine is used and the files are contained in
  <tt>/tmp/gaussian_run</tt>, clicking on
  <tt>/tmp/gaussian_run/gaussian.out</tt> will process the output and formatted
  checkpoint file (<tt>gaussian.fchk</tt>). Successful processing is based on
  the versions of MOE and the QM engine involved.
</p>

<a id="Results">
<h2>Results</h2>
</a>

<p>Once a calculation is complete, the <span class="nobr"><b>SCF
  Results</b></span> panel will be shown. Alternatively, an existing
  Wavefunction file can be opened using <span class="nobr"><b>MOE | File |
  Open</b></span>, which will also lead to this panel being shown:</p>
  <div align="center"><img src="scf/results.png" /></div>

<p>The <span class="nobr"><b>SCF Results</b></span> panel is a multi-page
  panel. The page is controlled by the option buttons at the top of the panel,
  which defaults to <b>Results</b>. Other pages which are available include
  <b>Atoms</b>, <b>Spectra</b>, <b>Eigenvalues</b>, <b>Transitions</b> and
  <b>Notes</b>.</p>

<p>The most prominent information summarizing the calculation is displayed on
  the <b>Results</b> page:</p>
  <table class="noborder">
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:left; vertical-align:top">Summary</th>
      <td style="padding: 0.5em;">The top left section of the page shows a 2D
      chemical diagram representation of the structure, and various other
      statistics including filename, engine, basis set, chemical formula,
      number of atoms, overall charge, number of atomic orbitals, number of
      electrons involved in the calculation, the total SCF energy (in
      Hartrees), the dipole moment (in Debye), the heat of formation (in
      kcal/mol, if available), the solvent model used and the number of
      negative vibrational frequencies (if available).</td>

    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:left; vertical-align:top">
      Molecular&nbsp;Orbital Diagram</th>
      <td style="padding: 0.5em;">The right hand side of the page is taken up
      by a graphical representation of the molecular orbital energy levels
      (eigenvalues). The levels are arranged in a form similar to that
      displayed in many textbooks, and attempt to capture the relative scale of
      the frontier orbitals, and show any degeneracies. Each orbital is marked
      with the number of electrons with which it is filled. The selected
      orbitals (HOMO and LUMO by default) are highlighted, and the energy gap
      between them is shown.</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:left; vertical-align:top">To, From</th>
      <td style="padding: 0.5em;">At any given time there are two orbital
      selections. The initial default selection is <b>From</b> = HOMO and
      <b>To</b> = LUMO. Unless they are changed to the same orbital, a red
      arrow is drawn onto the main graphic to illustrate the transition.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:left; vertical-align:top">Energy</th>
      <td style="padding: 0.5em;">The energy values of the two selected
      molecular orbitals are shown (<b>E(high)</b> and <b>E(low)</b>,
      respectively). By default the energies are given in <tt>au</tt> (atomic
      units, also known as Hartrees). Note the unit selection radio button to
      the right; the energies can also be shown in <tt>eV</tt> (electron
      volts). Note that <tt>nm</tt> (nanometers) is only appropriate for energy
      transitions, and so is not used for the individual energy levels.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:left; vertical-align:top">Delta&nbsp;E</th>
      <td style="padding: 0.5em;">If the <b>To</b> and <b>From</b> selections
      are not the same, the energy difference between them is shown using the
      selected units, be they <tt>au</tt>, <tt>eV</tt> or <tt>nm</tt>. Note
      that <tt>nm</tt> (nanometers) is a reciprocal unit and is proportional to
      the inverse of the energy difference.</td>

      <th style="text-align:left; vertical-align:top">Plot&nbsp;Style</th>
      <td style="padding: 0.5em;">
        The manner in which plots are displayed is controlled by this option
        menu, which consists of the following:
        <ul>
          <li><tt>Solid Surface</tt> (default): Plots are represented as a
          solid shell with a fully reflective surface.</li>

      <td style="padding: 0.5em;">Plots at least one molecular orbital. The
      orbitals which are plotted are all those which lie within the range From
      .. To (inclusive). In order for the orbital plots to be meaningful, the
      molecular system must be created within the MOE Window, which is done
      automatically, prompting for permission if necessary. The calculation
      required to generate each molecular orbital as a 3D grid is moderately
      time-consuming, and so a progress indicator is provided. Display of the
      orbitals can be changed using the Graphics Object Manager.</td>

<p>
Fukui Indices are used to describe local chemical reactivity based on the
frontier molecular orbitals (HOMO and LUMO).
The Fukui function describes the change in electron density when electrons are
added to the base state of a static molecule or removed from it.
The electrophilicity, or propensity for nucleophilic attack, is reported to
correlate with the Fukui function when adding a single electron to the LUMO.
The nucleophilicity correlates with the Fukui function when removing a single
electron from the HOMO. Radical attack susceptibility correlates with the mean
value of the first two.

      Basis&nbsp;Functions</th>
      <td style="padding: 0.5em;">The data which comprise the basis functions
      are displayed. The basis functions combined with the eigenvalues make up
      the wavefunction description of the molecule. Wavefunctions in MOE can be
      composed of either of two different varieties of basis functions: Slater
      orbitals or Gaussian orbitals. The former are typically favored by
      semi-empirical methods, the latter by ab initio methods.<br />
      <br />
      Regardless of type, each basis function has an index, an associated atom,
      and a center position (usually that of the associated atom). Both types
      have momentum terms for each Cartesian coordinate (MX, MY, MZ), which are
      zero for spherical orbitals and non-zero for the degenerate orbitals.
      Slater functions have an additional radial term (MR).<br />
      <br />
      Slater functions complete their description with the pre-exponential
      constant (zeta) and post-exponential constant (N). Gaussian functions are
      further divided into some number of contractions (usually 6 or less),
      each of which has a pre-exponential coefficient (Exp#) and a
      post-exponential constant (Coef#).</td>

<a id="Configuration">
<h1>Configuration</h1>
</a>

<p>
Several QM engines are included with MOE, each of which provides an
interface to an external package. The <tt>MOPAC</tt> application is
included with MOE, and is generally fully functional without any specific
configuration steps.  Computational codes from other vendors can be
configured as specified in
<a href="../moe/extprog.htm">Interfacing to External Programs</a> or
<a href="qmconfig.htm">Configuring a QM Engine</a>.
</p>

<p>
It is still possible to review data which has been calculated using one of
these engines, even if the application itself is not available locally.

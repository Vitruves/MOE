  <h1>Overview</h1>
</a>

<p>The <b>Capture</b> application provides ways to easily keep track of
  different system states. Typical uses of Capture include journaling
  work, recording thoughts and annotations, storing manually modified
  ligands with associated scores and remarks, and navigating to
  different saved views of interest in a system.  In this context, a
  <i>capture</i> is an association of a complete system state, a title,
  a set of comments, ligand properties, and a screenshot of the MOE
  window, with optionally the system view setup. These captures are
  stored in user-created <b>Capture</b> files, which are specialized
  MOE databases and have <tt>.mdb</tt> as their file extension.

</p>

<div class="floatleft">
  <img src="capture/menu.png" alt="Capture Menu" class="floatcenter" />
  <p class="caption"><b>Capture</b> menu</p>
</div>

<p>The <b>Capture</b> menu is reachable with <span class= "menu">MOE |
  RHS | Capture</span>.  The same menu is available from
  <span class="menu">MOE | File | Capture</span>; in the remainder of
  this document, all menu references will be to <span class="menu">MOE |
  RHS | Capture</span>, with the understanding that they can be
  equivalently found under the <span class="menu">MOE | File | Capture</span>
  menu.  Through this menu, new captures can be added,
  Capture files can be opened and closed, and, if a
  Capture file is currently open, a list of the captures
  contained in the file can be accessed.
  </p>

<div class="floatright">
  <img src="capture/open.png" alt="Open panel" class="center" />
  <p class="caption">Open Capture File</p>
  <img src="capture/list.png" alt="List Menu" class="center" />
  <p class="caption">List of captures</p>
</div>
  
<p>To start using the <b>Capture</b> application, a Capture file must
  first be opened through <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Capture |
  Open</span>.  This brings up the <b>Open Capture File</b> panel. To
  open an existing Capture file, select <b>Open</b>, then either
  use the browse button <img src="capture/button_browse.png"
  style="vertical-align:middle" /> to navigate to the file or enter its
  path in the text field, then press OK.  Alternatively, double-click in
  the list of recently-used Capture files as displayed in the
  <b>Recent</b> list; the file will open directly.
</p>
  
<p>To create and open a new Capture file, press <b>Create</b>,
  then either use the browse button <img src="capture/button_browse.png"
  style="vertical-align:middle" /> to navigate to the directory in which
  to save the file, then enter the name of the file, or enter the full
  path and name of the new file in the text field. Once the name has
  been specified, press OK.  The file suffix <tt>(.mdb)</tt> is
  automatically added if omitted.  If no path is given, the file will be
  created in the current working directory. If the file name corresponds
  to an existing file, that file will be overwritten.  Once a
  Capture file is opened, it will remain open until it is closed
  by using the <span class="menu">Close </span> menu option or by
  closing the MOE session.

</p>
  
<p>New captures can be <a href="#Creation">added</a> to a
  Capture file using <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Capture |
  Add</span>.  The captures saved in the currently-open Capture file can
  be accessed from a popup list panel raised by
  <span class="menu">MOE | RHS |
  Capture | List</span>; note that this menu item is available only when
  a Capture file is currently open.

</p>

<p>The scrollable and sortable list of captures displays titles and
  creation dates, along with ligand properties, if any. Clicking on an
  entry will close the current system and load into MOE the system saved
  in that entry.
</p>
  
<p><span class="warning">Warning!</span> Loading a capture will close
  the current MOE system without putting up a confirmation dialog.
</p>

<p>If the current Capture file contains five or more
  captures, a search bar will appear, providing the ability to filter
  the list using search patterns.
</p>

<p>The index number displayed in the first column
  of the list corresponds to the position of that capture's entry in the
  Capture file.
  When a capture is loaded, its entry index is displayed in a message
  in the upper-right corner of
  the MOE Window.  The index is also displayed
  in the title bar of the <a href="#Update">Edit</a> panel to help
  identify which entry is being edited.
  In the Capture <a href="#Footer">footer</a>,
  the indices are used to number the browsing buttons.
</p>

<p>More features such as capture navigation, reordering, and update are
  available in the <b>Capture</b> <a href="#Footer">footer</a>
  and <a href="#Footer">panel</a>.
</p>

<a id="Creation">
  <h1>Adding a Capture</h1>
</a>

<p>The <b>Add</b> panel is used to capture the current MOE system.  It is
  opened with <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Capture | Add</span>.
  A visual snapshot of the system to be saved is displayed.  If
  <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Ligand |
  <a href="./ligx.htm#Properties">Ligand Properties</a></span> is
  currently enabled, ligand properties will be included in the
  display. The <b>Title</b>, <b>Comment</b> and <b>Save</b> options can be
  set as desired.  Pressing <b>OK</b> will add a new capture to the
  current Capture file.
</p>

<div class="floatright"><img src="capture/add_panel.png" alt=
  "New Capture Panel" class="floatright" /></div>

<p>The cursor position can be switched between the <b>Title</b> and
  <b>Comment</b> text fields by pressing Tab on the keyboard.
  A pulldown list located in
  the rightmost position of the <b>Title</b> text field contains title
  suggestions based on the names of the chains in the system and
  previous captures.  Pressing <b>OK</b> with empty <b>Title</b> and
  <b>Comment</b> text fields will create a capture with the default
  title that consists of the names of the active chains; by default
  the comment is left empty.
  Note: use Shift-Tab in the Comment field to add a tab in the
  text.
</p>

<p>The <b>Save</b> options are preserved from session to session.
</p>

<table class="noborder">
  <tr>
    <td><b>Active Tags</b></td>
    <td>If on, only the tags with active atoms will be saved in
    the new capture, otherwise all chains will be saved.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Surfaces</b></td>
    <td>If on, surfaces will be saved in the new capture, otherwise
    surfaces will not be saved.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Ligand Only</b></td>
    <td>If on, only the active ligand will be saved in the new capture,
    otherwise the whole system will be saved (in accordance with
    the <b>Active Tags</b> setting).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Theme</b></td>

    <td>If on, the current <a href= "../appendix/viewsetup.htm">View
      Setup</a> will be saved as part of the new capture.  Note that if
      <b>Theme</b> is disabled, when the capture is subsequently loaded,
      whatever theme is in use at that time will continue to be in
      effect, regardless of what theme is displayed in the bubble help
      thumbnail in the list of captures or in the Add or Edit panels.

    </td>
  </tr>

<a id="Footer">
  <h1>Capture Footer and Panel</h1>
</a>

<p><b>Capture</b> can be launched as an attached or detached panel
  from the list of captures (<span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Capture
  | List</span>, only available when a Capture file has been opened).
  In attached mode, Capture opens in the MOE Footer, otherwise it
  can be opened as a detached
  panel.  Pressing the top right button in the list popup displayed by
  the menu option <span class="menu">List...</span> will bring up the
  <b>Capture</b> footer or detached window, depending on which preferred
  location is chosen in the <a href="#Settings">Capture Settings</a>.
  The attach button <img src="capture/sys_attach.png"
  style="vertical-align:middle" /> opens the footer mode and the detach
  button <img src="capture/sys_detach.png" style="vertical-align:middle"
  /> opens the detached window. The default mode is attached at the
  bottom of the MOE window.
</p>

<img src="capture/footer.png" class="center" />
<p class="caption"><b>Capture</b> footer</p>

<div class="floatright"><img src="capture/footer_popup.png" alt=
  "Capture Panel" class="center" />
  <p class="caption"><b>Capture</b> Footer List Panel</p>
</div>

<p>The <b>Capture</b> footer is meant to provide easy access
  while being unobtrusive, making it suitable for presentations
  and working with multiple simultaneous panels. It allows one to:
</p>


  <ul>
    <li>
      Preview and load any capture from the current Capture file
      using the numbered list, along with navigation
      <img src="capture/button_nav_1.png" style="vertical-align:middle" />
      <img src="capture/button_nav_2.png" style="vertical-align:middle" />
      buttons.
    </li>
    <li>
      Browse, search, and manage the list of captures with the footer list panel
      opened by the <b>List</b> button.
    </li>
    <li>
      Open the <b>Add</b> panel to add a new capture with the <b>Add</b>
      <img src="capture/button_add.png" style="vertical-align:middle" /> button.
    </li>
    <li>
      Open the <b>Edit</b> panel to edit the currently selected capture with the
      <b>Edit</b>
      <img src="capture/button_edit.png" style="vertical-align:middle" /> button.
    </li>
  </ul>

<p>
  The index numbers in the numbered list of the captures correspond
  to the positions of the entries in the Capture file.
  Hovering the mouse over a numbered
  button will display a preview of the capture with its title.
  Pressing a numbered button or the navigation buttons will close
  the current system and load
  the corresponding capture, highlighting it in the list.
</p>

<p>
  The footer list popup is similar to that opened by
  <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Capture | List</span>,
  but has more features.
  The name of the current Capture file is displayed at the top
  of the popup and can be changed by selecting <b>Open</b>
  in the menu
  <img src="capture/button_file.png" style="vertical-align:middle" />.
  This menu also provides an <b>Open DBV</b> option for opening
  the Capture file in a Database Viewer.
</p>

<p>
  The capture list displays the capture indices, titles, and creation
  dates, plus ligand properties if any. It is scrollable and sortable.
  Clicking on an entry will close the current
  system and load the system saved in that entry. 
</p>

<p><span class="warning">Warning!</span> Loading a capture will close
  the current MOE system without putting up a confirmation dialog.
</p>

<p>Typing in the search bar will dynamically search the
  text of all titles, comments, and properties shown in the list
  for matches to the search pattern as it is being entered.
  This filtering is case insensitive.
</p>

<p>
  The footer list panel also contains additional controls. 
  Similarly to those in the footer itself, the Add
  <img src="capture/button_add.png" style="vertical-align:middle" />
  and Edit
  <img src="capture/button_edit.png" style="vertical-align:middle" />
  buttons will open their respective panels.
  The move up 
  <img src="capture/button_up.png" style="vertical-align:middle" />
  and move down
  <img src="capture/button_down.png" style="vertical-align:middle" />
  buttons can be used to change the position of the selected
  capture in the list. Doing so will change the position of the capture's
  entry in the Capture file. Note: changing position is only available
  when the capture list is sorted by index and unfiltered.
  Pressing the delete
  <img src="capture/button_delete.png" style="vertical-align:middle" />
  button will remove the selected capture from the Capture file.
</p>

<p><span class="warning">Warning!</span> Deleting a capture from
  the Capture file cannot be undone.
</p>

<p>Pressing the detach button <img src="capture/sys_detach.png"
  style="vertical-align:middle" /> in the footer will close the footer
  and open the detached <b>Capture</b> window.  This window is identical
  in function to the footer popup, but additionally displays the title and
  complete comment of the selected capture.
</p>

  <div class="center"><img src="capture/panel.png" alt=
    "Capture Panel" class="center" />
    <p class="caption">Detached <b>Capture</b> panel</p>
  </div>

<a id="Update">
  <h1>Capture Modification</h1>
</a>
<div class="floatright">
  <img src="capture/edit_panel.png" alt="Edit Panel" class="floatcenter" />
</div>

<p>Saved captures can be updated using the Edit panel. This panel
  allows one to modify the title and comment, and to optionally
  replace the complete system of a previously saved capture.
</p>

<p>The system saved in the current capture and the current MOE system are
  displayed side-by-side in the panel. Selecting
  <b>Keep Saved System</b> will leave the system saved in the capture
  unmodified,
  while selecting <b>Overwrite With Current System</b> will overwrite the
  saved system with the current system in MOE.
</p>

<p>The other options of the Edit panel are the same as in the
  <a href="#Creation">Add</a> panel.
  The <b>Title</b> and <b>Comment</b> text fields contain the title and
  comments saved in the selected capture and can be edited. As in the
  <b>Add</b> panel, the cursor position can be switched between the text
  fields by pressing Tab.  A pulldown list located in the rightmost
  position of the Title text field contains title suggestions.
  Note that the <b>Save</b> options are only available
  when <b>Overwrite With Current System</b> is selected,
</p>

<p>
  Pressing <b>OK</b> will update the capture.
  <span class="warning">Warning!</span> This operation
  cannot be undone.
</p>

<a id="Settings">
  <h1>Capture Settings</h1>
</a>

<div class="floatright"><img src="capture/settings.png" alt=
  "Capture Settings" class="floatright" /></div>

<p> The gear button
  <img src="capture/button_settings.png" style="vertical-align:middle" /> 
  opens a panel to configure the default settings for <b>Capture</b>.</p>

<table class="noborder">
  <tr>
    <td><b>Open Mode</b></td>
    <td>Choose the default mode for <b>Capture</b> when the <b>Capture</b>
      panel is launched from the list of captures opened using
      <span class="menu">MOE | RHS | Capture | List</span>.
      <ul>
        <li><i>Detached</i>. <b>Capture</b> will open in a separate window.
	   In the list of captures, the launch button will appear as  
	   <img src="capture/sys_detach.png" style="vertical-align:middle" />.
	</li>
	<li><i>Attached</i>. <b>Capture</b> will open in the MOE Footer.
	   In the list of captures, the launch button will appear as  
	   <img src="capture/sys_attach.png" style="vertical-align:middle" />.
	</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Transitions</b></td>
    <td>Enable animated transitions between captures and set the
      transition duration, in seconds.</td>
  </tr>

    <td><b>Bubble Help</b></td>
    <td>Enable a picture of the system or the capture's comment to be shown
      when the mouse is hovered over a capture in the list.</td>

<h1>Representing Combinatorial Libraries</h1>

<p>A combinatorial (or virtual) library can be represented as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>One or more scaffold molecules</li>
    <li>A set of R-group libraries</li>
    <li>Connection information specifying where the R-groups attach to each
    scaffold</li>
  </ul>

<p>This representation is the traditional form, used in the <a href=
  "frag_combi.htm">Combinatorial Builder</a> for example. A combinatorial
  library can also be represented as a chemical reaction:</p>

<img src="combitools/introrxn1.png" alt="Intro Reaction 1" class="center" />

<p>The structures on the left define the two components (or reactants) of the
  reaction and the structure on the right defines the product. At minimum,
  individual components must uniquely specify the desired chemical
  functionality that all reagents must contain. <font color="blue">Blue</font>
  numbers relate component and product atoms preserved in the reaction.
  Component atoms lacking pair-numbers help identify the reagents and are then
  discarded. Right-side atoms lacking pair-numbers are added to the product(s).
  <font color="brown">Brown</font> annotations are <i>query properties</i> used
  when identifying reagents. In this example, atom <font color="blue">8</font>
  can be a carbon or hydrogen. The combinatorial library can be enumerated from
  the reagents satisfying each component.</p>

<p>Transformations expressed as chemical reactions were introduced with
  <a href="shaman.htm">MedChem Transformations</a> and its <a href=
  "https://www.chemcomp.com/moe/help/2018/CCG_Tutorials/(Tutorial)_MOE_MedChem_Transformations_In-Cleft.svlx">
  In-Cleft tutorial</a>, using simple reactions of the form <span class=
  "nobr"><tt>A -&gt; A<sup>'</sup></tt></span>. <b>Combinatorial
  Library</b> introduces three additional types:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><i>chemical reactions</i> of the form <span class="nobr"><tt>A + B +
    ... -&gt; C</tt></span></li>
    <li><i>clip reactions</i> that replace chemical functionality with an
    attachment point</li>
    <li><i>combinatorial reactions</i> involving a scaffold and a number of
    R-group components.</li>
  </ul>
<a id="Attach"></a>
<h2>Attachment points</h2>

<p>Attachment points in MOE are terminal atoms named <tt>A<i>n</i></tt> that
  indicate where connections can be made. In scaffolds, <i>n</i> usually ranges
  from 1 to 9 while in R-groups <i>n</i> can be 0 or 1. This scaffold</p>

<img src="combitools/combi_scaff.png" alt=
  "Scaffold Attachment Points" class="center" />

<p>can make up to four connections at the designated atoms. The attachment
  point names for scaffolds should be unique. R-groups can have one or two
  attachment points, based on whether they are <i>monodentate</i> or
  <i>bidentate</i>. This R-group</p>

<img src="combitools/combi_rgroup.png" alt=
  "R-group Attachment Points" class="center" />

<p>forms two attachments (it is bidentate), labeled <tt>A0</tt> and
  <tt>A1</tt>. R-groups can have multiple attachment points with the same name;
  all will be used in turn if they satisfy the individual components of the
  reaction. Note that attachment points can also appear as <tt>R<i>n</i></tt>
  as in <a href="view2d.htm">2D Molecules</a>. 2D sketchers depict attachment
  points differently: they are terminal atoms named <tt>R<i>n</i></tt>, where
  <i>n</i> is a positive integer. The R-group attachment point <tt>A0</tt> is
  represented as an asterisk, shown as <tt><font color="brown">*</font></tt> in
  the clip reaction <a href="#ClipReaction">below</a>. A bidentate R-group
  would be sketched with atoms labeled <tt>*</tt> and <tt>R1</tt>.
<a id="Reactions"></a>
</p>

<h2>Creating Reactions</h2>

<p>Atoms in a reaction can be represented by their chemical symbol, a
  wildcard, an attachment point name or a query property. The meaning of
  individual symbols can change whether they appear on the component or the
  product side of the reaction: the former defines a search query while the
  latter specifies a molecular structure. The following table contains the
  symbols and their meanings for the reaction's components:</p>
  <table class="titlebar">
    <tr>
      <th>Symbol</th>
      <th>Definition</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center"><b>A</b></td>
      <td>Any non-hydrogen atom</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center"><b>Q</b></td>
      <td>Any non-hydrogen, non-carbon atom</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center"><b>X</b></td>
      <td>Any halogen atom</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center"><b>M</b></td>
      <td>Any metal atom</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center"><b>R</b></td>
      <td>Any atom</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center"><b>*</b></td>
      <td>Attachment point 0 (A<sub>0</sub> or R<sub>0</sub>)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center"><b>R<i>n</i></b></td>
      <td>Chemical reaction: any atom
      Combinatorial reaction: attachment point <i>n</i></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

<p><tt>R<i>n</i></tt> symbols can be used in chemical reactions to provide
  information to the <a href="#ActionMenu"><b>Pair Reaction</b></a> action
  (i.e. <tt>R1</tt> in the components is associated with <tt>R1</tt> in the
  product(s).) In addition, query properties can be specified for individual
  atoms:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the number of non-hydrogen substituents</li>
    <li>the absence of hydrogen substituents</li>
    <li>the number of connecting ring bonds</li>
    <li>the list of allowed chemical symbols</li>
    <li>the list of forbidden chemical symbols</li>
    <li>its stereochemistry</li>
  </ul>

<p>The following table contains the symbols and their meanings for the
  reaction's products:</p>
  <table class="titlebar">
    <tr>
      <th>Symbol</th>
      <th>Definition</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center"><b>A</b></td>
      <td>Copy properties from atom-paired reagent atom</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center"><b>R</b></td>
      <td>Copy properties from atom-paired reagent atom</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center"><b>*</b></td>
      <td>Attachment point 0 (A<sub>0</sub> or R<sub>0</sub>)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center"><b>R<i>n</i></b></td>
      <td>Chemical reaction: copy properties from atom-paired reagent
      atom
      Clip or combinatorial reaction: attachment point <i>n</i></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

<p>The following reaction shows how <tt>A</tt> can be used:</p>

<img src="combitools/introrxn4.png" alt="Intro Reaction 4" class="center" />

<p>Atom <font color="blue">6</font> can be matched by a carbon or nitrogen.
  The <tt>A</tt>, the corresponding product atom, means &quot;whatever
  component atom was found&quot;. This provides the flexibility needed to
  handle component atoms with complex query properties. <tt>R</tt> (and
  <tt>R<i>n</i></tt>) mean the same thing as <tt>A</tt> and can be used on the
  product side to provide information for the <span class="nobr"><b>Pair
  Reaction</b></span> action.</p>

<p>Bonds in a reaction can be represented by their bond symbol or a wildcard.
  The following table contains the wildcards and their meanings for the
  reaction's components:</p>
  <table class="titlebar">
    <tr>
      <th>Symbol</th>
      <th>Definition</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle"><img src=
      "combitools/bicon1.png" alt="Any bond" /></td>
      <td>Any bond</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle"><img src=
      "combitools/bicon2.png" alt="Single or double bond" /></td>
      <td>Single or double bond</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle"><img src=
      "combitools/bicon3.png" alt="Single or aromatic bond" /></td>
      <td>Single or aromatic bond</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle"><img src=
      "combitools/bicon4.png" alt="Double or aromatic bond" /></td>
      <td>Double or aromatic bond</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

<p>In addition, two properties can be specified for individual bonds:
  <b>chain-</b> or <b>ring-only</b> and its stereochemistry. The following
  reaction shows how the <tt>Any</tt> bond symbol can be used:</p>

<img src="combitools/introrxn5.png" alt="Intro Reaction 4" class="center" />

<p>The bond between atoms <font color="blue">3</font> and <font color=
  "blue">4</font> on the component side means that any type of bond will
  satisfy the reagent search for component two. Its use on the product side
  means &quot;whatever bond type was found&quot;, preserving the specific
  connection in the product. This reaction also demonstrates that reactions
  need not be stoichiometric, as the product's oxygen atom is not present
  in either of the reaction's components.
<a id="ClipReaction"></a>
</p>

<p><b>Clip Reactions.</b> Clip reactions are transformations that replace
  portions of the structure with attachment points:</p>

<img src="combitools/introrxn2.png" alt="Intro Reaction 2" class="center" />

<p>This reaction converts an acid halide into an R-group, removing the
  halogen and replacing it with <tt><font color="brown">*</font></tt>
  (attachment point 0). These are represented in the output file as a carbon
  atom with the label <tt>A0</tt> and three implicit hydrogens (i.e. a methyl
  group). Combinatorial reactions are those with a <tt><font color=
  "brown">*</font></tt> on at least one component atom. An example will be
  provided <a href="#ClipRGroup">below</a>.</p>

<p><b>Combinatorial Enumeration.</b> Combinatorial reactions represent the
  enumeration process:</p>

<img src="combitools/introrxn3.png" alt="Intro Reaction 3" class="center" />

<p>The scaffold is the first component and the R-group is the second. The
  attachment points are represented by <tt><font color="brown">R1</font></tt>
  and <tt><font color="brown">*</font></tt> and the product is formed by
  replacing these atoms with the bond between atoms 14 and 15. The number of
  reagents satisfying the individual component searches determines the maximum
  size of the combinatorial library. Combinatorial reactions can be used with
  multiple scaffolds, or the <a href="#ActionMenu">From MOE</a> action can
  create a reaction from a scaffold in MOE.
<a id="FocusReagents"></a>
</p>

<h1>Focusing Reagent Libraries</h1>

<p><b>Focus Reagents</b> is used to estimate the activity of a virtual
  library formed from a scaffold and a collection of R-groups. By assigning an
  activity score to each R-group, a pure combinatorial design can be achieved
  by using this score first to cluster the R-groups and then to select the best
  candidates. The activity is estimated by statistical sampling of the chemical
  space spanned by all possible R-group substitutions.</p>

<h2>Theory and Formulation</h2>

<p>Imagine counting the number of times that a given R-group or scaffold
  group molecule <i>m</i> appears in a biologically active compound. This count
  can be expressed as:</p>

<img src="combitools/count.png" alt="Formula 1" class="center" />

<p>where the sum extends over all compounds <i>k</i> in the combinatorial
  library. The assessment of activity used is a Binary QSAR model, which
  outputs the probability that a compound is active. This allows the activity
  assessment to be replaced with a softer (probabilistic) one:</p>

<img src="combitools/softcount.png" alt="Formula 2" class="center" />

<p>To avoid enumerating the library, the summation can be replaced with a
  Monte Carlo integration as follows. Assuming a uniform sampling of the
  combinatorial library and sample <i>p</i> molecules gives:</p>

<img src="combitools/estimate.png" alt="Formula 3" class="center" />

<p>where <i>V</i> is the number of compounds in the combinatorial library and
  <i>X<sub>i</sub></i> is the <i>i</i><sup>th</sup> of <i>p</i> sampled
  molecules. To avoid explicit use of the number of compounds in the
  combinatorial library, the count can be normalized by dividing by the total
  number of active compounds in the combinatorial library:</p>

<img src="combitools/probability.png" alt="Formula" class="center" />

<p>This approximate value to <i>P</i>(<i>m</i>) is what is written as output
  for each source database R-group or central group. The sampling process
  proceeds as follows:</p>
  <ol start="1">
    <li>Randomly select R-groups for each component.</li>
    <li>Construct the product, connecting the R-groups to the scaffold.</li>
    <li>Discard the product if it fails the Descriptor Filter (if
    specified).</li>
    <li>Calculate the product activity using the activity model.</li>
    <li>Add the activity to the tally for each R-group and the active product
    count.</li>
  </ol>

<p>This is repeated until the desired percentage of the combinatorial library
  has been sampled. <b>Focus Reagents</b> writes an output file for each
  component containing the approximate <i>P(m)</i> values for each reagent.
<a id="Diverse"></a>
</p>

<h1>Diverse Selection from Library</h1>

<p><b>Diverse Selection</b> is used to select a diverse collection of
  compounds from a virtual combinatorial library of compounds. The virtual
  library is constructed by combining <i>scaffold</i> molecules with a set of
  <i>R-groups</i>. The diverse subset is created by statistical sampling of the
  &quot;chemical space&quot; spanned by all possible R-group/scaffold
  substitutions.</p>

<h2>Theory and Formulation</h2>

<p><b>Diverse Selection</b> is able to select diverse subsets from
  arbitrarily large virtual libraries for one simple reason: <i>the virtual
  library is never enumerated</i>. In conventional techniques, one first
  enumerates the library by forming all combinations of scaffolds and R-groups.
  This is followed by descriptor calculation, Principal Components Analysis and
  Diverse Subset Selection. This application uses sampling techniques for each
  of the sub-calculations thereby eliminating the enumeration.</p>

<p>The Basic Sampling Operation is used to select a random member from the
  virtual library spanned by the central and R-group databases. The Basic
  Sampling Operation proceeds as follows:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Randomly select a scaffold molecule.</li>
    <li>Randomly select R-group molecules, one per attachment point on the
    scaffold molecule.</li>
    <li>Construct the product.</li>
    <li>Test against the Descriptor Filter. Discard the product and return to
    step 1 if the product fails the filter. This is repeated a maximum of 1000
    times.</li>
    <li>Calculate the properties specified by <b>Use Descriptors</b> for the
    product molecule..</li>
  </ol>

<p>At the highest level, <b>Diverse Selection</b> proceeds in three
  phases:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>PCA:</b>. Principal components analysis. The Basic Sampling
    Operation is repeatedly performed a fixed number of times. A mean and
    covariance matrix is accumulated and diagonalized. A linear transform
    <i>Q</i> and a vector <i>u</i> are calculated such that for a given
    descriptor vector <i>x</i>, <span class=
    "nobr"><i>Q</i>(<i>x</i>-<i>u</i>)</span> has a mean of 0 and a variance
    equal to the identity matrix.
    </li>
    <li><b>VAR:</b>. Mean and Variance Estimation. A random subset of size
    <i>k</i> is repeatedly obtained using the Basic Sampling Operation. The PCA
    transforms are used to de-correlate and normalize the descriptors. The
    diversity metric is evaluated on each sampled subset. In this way, the mean
    and variance of the diversity of a subset of size <i>k</i> is estimated.
    This allows the diversity of a subset to be measured in terms of its
    Z-score, the number of standard deviations away from random.
    </li>
    <li><b>MC:</b>. Monte Carlo Simulated Annealing. A random subset of size
    <i>k</i> is used as the starting point. A simulated annealing calculation
    is then used to randomly exchange members of the subset for random
    molecules obtained with the Basic Sampling Operation. A Metropolis
    rejection criterion is used to optimize the diversity metric.</li>
  </ol>

<p>The diversity metric is an entropy-based metric that encourages coverage
  of the entire virtual library spanned by the scaffold and R-group databases;
  this metric does not merely look for extreme molecules but for good coverage.

        <p class="indent_novspace"><span class="menu">MOE | File |
        Open</span></p>

        <p>In the Open panel, select <span class=
        "nobr"><tt>$MOE/sample/mol/gmp_scaffold.mdb</tt></span> and press
        <b>OK</b>. This opens a Database Viewer. Double-click on the structure
        in the <tt>mol</tt> field to load it into MOE. This scaffold has four
        attachment points, which can be seen by displaying the atom
        names.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Start <b>Combinatorial Library</b>:</p>
        <p class="indent_novspace"><span class="menu">MOE | Compute | QuaSAR |
        Combinatorial Library</span></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Create the combinatorial reaction:</p>
        <p class="indent_novspace"><span class="menu">Action Menu | From
        MOE</span></p>

        <p>This creates a five component reaction and assigns
        atom-pairing as appropriate. The first component is the scaffold from
        MOE, and the other four are the R-group libraries.</p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p><i>Associate R-group libraries with each attachment point</i>:</p>

      <p>Press the button for each component from second to fifth.</p>
      <p>In <b>Reagents</b>, enter <span class=
      "nobr"><tt>$MOE/sample/mol/gmp_r<i>n</i>.mdb</tt></span> or use the
      <b>Browse</b> button to select this file.</p>

      <p>Press <b>OK</b> to close the <b>Filter Reagent Library</b> panel.</p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p><i>Define the <b>Diverse Selection</b> calculation</i>:</p>

      <p>Change <b>Operation</b> to <b>Diverse Selection</b>.</p>
      <p>Press <b>Select</b> and select Weight, SlogP and TPSA as <b>Use
      Descriptors</b>.</p>
      <p>Enter <tt>druglike</tt> as the <b>Descriptor Filter</b>.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>At this point, the panel should look like</p>
  <img src="combitools/diverseex1.png"
  alt="Diverse Subset 1" class="center"/>
  <p>There are a maximum
  of 6480 products in the combinatorial library. Press <b>OK</b> to start the
  calculation. This will take a few minutes to generate a 50-member diverse
  selection, which is written to <tt>combitools.mdb</tt>. Progress
  information is provided in the SVL Commands window.</p>

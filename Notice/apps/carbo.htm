<p>The MOE Carbohydrate Builder allows you to create different types of
  carbohydrate polymers by linking individual sugar residues at specific
  positions. The builder also allows you to invert chiral centers or entire
  residues, mutate residues in existing carbohydrate structures, and specify
  the glycosidic torsion angles between residues when adding new residues to an
  existing structure.</p>

<p>For a more in-depth discussion, please consult references given at the end
  of this document (in particular, ref. 1 and 3).</p>

<a id="OverviewCarboChemistry"></a>
<h1>Overview of Carbohydrate Chemistry</h1>

<p>For the most part, carbohydrate polymers, or polysaccharides, are composed
  of cyclic monosaccharide units, or &quot;sugar residues,&quot; linked
  together into single-branched or multiple-branched chains. The nature of a
  polysaccharide is dictated by the positions at which the monosaccharide
  residues link with one other, the degree of branching at any given residue,
  as well as the types of residues themselves.</p>

<a id="LinearMonosaccharideUnits"></a>
<h2>Linear Monosaccharide Units</h2>

<p>The basic unit of a carbohydrate polymer is the cyclic monosaccharide
  residue. Cyclic monosaccharide residues are created by the intramolecular
  cyclization of linear saccharides, which are simply straight-chain
  polyhydroxyl aldehydes and ketones. The Fischer projections of the D-aldose
  and D-ketose families of linear saccharides (see figures below) show the
  stereochemical relationships between the different saccharides and
  demonstrate the large number of diastereomeric forms that monosaccharides can
  assume. Note that the &quot;L&quot; form of any monosaccharide is simply the
  enantiomer of the &quot;D&quot; form.</p>


<img src="carbo/carbo_fig1.gif" alt="Figure 1" class="center" />
<p class="caption">Figure 1: Family of D-aldoses</p>

<img src="carbo/carbo_fig2.gif" alt="Figure 2" class="center"/>
<p class="caption">Figure 2: Family of D-ketoses</p>

<a id="CyclicMonosaccharideUnits"></a>
<h2>Cyclic Monosaccharide Units</h2>

<p>The majority of carbohydrates do not exist in their straight-chain form.
  Instead, monosaccharides cyclize through nucleophilic attack of the carbonyl
  carbon by one of the hydroxyl groups. As demonstrated by the classic case of
  aldo-D-glucose cyclization, glucose can cyclize into five-membered
  <i>furanose</i> or six-membered <i>pyranose</i> ring systems. The two
  possible orientations of the nucleophilic attack give rise to
  &quot;alpha&quot; and &quot;beta&quot; forms of each ring system, called
  <i>anomers</i>.</p>

<img src="carbo/carbo_fig3.gif" alt="Figure 3" class="center" />
<p class="caption">Figure 3: Cyclization of aldo-D-glucose to furanose and
pyranose forms</p>

<p>The vast majority of carbohydrates cyclize to either five-membered
  furanose ring systems or six-membered pyranose ring systems, all of which
  have a <i>ring oxygen</i> atom, an <i>anomeric carbon</i> atom, and an
  <i>anomeric oxygen</i> atom, as indicated in the figure below.  On rare
  occasions the ring oxygen is replaced by a nitrogen, sulfur, or even
  selenium atom.</p>

<img src="carbo/carbo_fig4.gif" alt="Figure 4" class="center" />
<p class="caption">Figure 4</p>

<p>In addition to these atoms, there is usually a non-anomeric carbon atom
  known as the <i>configurational carbon</i> attached to the ring oxygen.
  Strictly speaking, this carbon is the configurational carbon only if it is a
  chiral center [McNaught&nbsp;1997]. However, for our present purposes, we
  will always refer to this carbon as the configurational carbon, regardless of
  its stereochemistry.</p>

<a id="LinkNumbering"></a>
<h2>Atom Numbering and Glycosidic Link Specification in Polysaccharides</h2>

<p>The carbon atoms in a cyclic monosaccharide residue are numbered so that
  the anomeric carbon has the lowest possible number, as demonstrated in the
  atom numbering schemes of alpha-D-glucopyranose and beta-D-fructofuranose
  shown below. Oxygen atoms are given the same number as the carbon atom to
  which they are attached.</p>

<img src="carbo/carbo_fig5.gif" alt="Figure 5" class="center" />
<p class="caption">Figure 5</p>

<p>The numbering system of a monosaccharide residue is used to indicate the
  positions at which a residue covalently links to other residues in a given
  polymeric structure. For example, common table sugar, or sucrose, is a
  disaccharide of alpha-D-glucopyranose and beta-D-fructofuranose, linked
  together through an oxygen atom that is simultaneously at position 1 on
  alpha-D-glucopyranose and position 2 on beta-D-fructofuranose.</p>

<img src="carbo/carbo_fig6.gif" alt="Figure 6" class="center" />
<p class="caption">Figure 6</p>

<p>The oxygen atom that connects the two residues is called the <i>glycosidic
  oxygen</i>, and the linkage itself is referred to as an <i>O-glycosidic
  linkage</i>. Since the link is between the 1 position on the glucose unit and
  the 2 position on the fructose unit, the linkage is referred to as a 1-2
  linkage.</p>

<p>Using link positions allows textual specification of polysaccharide
  structures. For example, sucrose may be written as</p>

<p>a-D-glucopyranose(1-2)b-D-fructofuranose</p>

<p>where the (1-2) specifies that the 1 position of glucose links to the 2
  position of fructose. Furthermore, residue abbreviations enable more concise
  textual expression;</p>

<p class="center">a-DGlcp(1-2)b-DFruf</p>

<p>The reader is referred to the end of this document for a list of
  carbohydrate residue abbreviations used in MOE, and to references 3 and 4 for
  a more complete discussion of representing polysaccharides with this
  notation.</p>

<p>In most polysaccharides, glycosidic linkages form between the anomeric
  position on one residue and hydroxyl groups on other residues. For example,
  cellulose consists of long, unbranched chains of (1-4) linked
  beta-D-glucopyranose, as shown in the figure below:</p>

<img src="carbo/carbo_fig7.gif" alt="Figure 7" class="center" />
<p class="caption">Figure 7</p>
<a id="GlycosidicTorsionAngles"></a>
<h2>Glycosidic Torsion Angles</h2>

<p>The inter-residue torsion angles around glycosidic linkages in
  polysaccharides greatly influence the conformation of the polymeric chain.
  These torsion angles, often referred to as <i>glycosidic torsions</i>, are
  defined by the atoms shown in the following figure.</p>

<img src="carbo/carbo_fig8.gif" alt="Figure 8" class="center"/>
<p class="caption">Figure 8</p>

<p>In MOE, the glycosidic torsion angles are defined by analogy with the
  psi-H and phi-H torsion angles in IUPAC convention [Homans&nbsp;1990]:</p>
<ul>
  <li><tt>[H1, C1, O1, CX]</tt> defines the <b>psi</b> glycosidic dihedral
  angle</li>
  <li><tt>[HX, CX, O1, C1]</tt> defines the <b>phi</b> glycosidic dihedral
  angle</li>
  <li><tt>[HY, CY, CX, O1]</tt> defines the <b>omega</b> glycosidic dihedral
  angle</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the omega torsion angle is defined only for residues linked
  through an extra exocyclic (-Cx-) unit in addition to the glycosidic
  oxygen.</p>

<h1>MOE Carbohydrate Builder</h1>

<p>The MOE Carbohydrate Builder allows you to build polysaccharides by adding
  monosaccharide residues to the system one at a time. The Carbohydrate Builder
  provides a library of common residues, a list of which is included at the end
  of this document. You may also define your own carbohydrate monomer units in
  a customized database, as described in the section on adding new residues to
  the carbohydrate library.</p>

<p>In the MOE Window, choose <span class="menu">MOE | Edit | Build |
  Carbohydrate</span>. The Carbohydrate Builder panel appears as follows:</p>

<h1>Carbohydrate Database</h1>
<a id="MakingCustom"></a>
<h2>Making a Customized Carbohydrate Database</h2>

<p>Carbohydrate residues are supplied to the Carbohydrate Builder by a
  carbohydrate database called <tt>carbo.mdb</tt>, which is located in the
  <tt>$MOE/lib</tt> directory. You can customize this database by adding new
  residues. However, you must first make a copy of the database as it is
  'read-only' to avoid accidental deletion of data.</p>

<a id="Examples_making_custom_carbo_mdb"></a>
<div class="example">

  <h2>Example: Making a Customized Carbohydrate Database</h2>

  <p>This example shows how to make an editable copy of the standard MOE
    carbohydrate database.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p><i>Open the carbohydrate database in a Database Viewer</i>.</p>
      <p class="blockquote">
        <span class="menu">MOE | File | Open |
        <tt>$MOE/lib/carbo.mdb</tt></span>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><i>Make a copy of the database.</i></p>
      <p>Save the database under a new filename. For the purposes of this
      exercise, we will refer to the database as
      <tt>'carbo_custom.mdb'</tt>.</p>
      <p class="blockquote">
        <span class="menu">DBV | File | Save As |
        <tt>carbo_custom.mdb</tt></span>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><i>Instruct the Carbohydrate Builder to point to the new
      database.</i></p>
      <p>In the SVL Commands window <span class="nobr">(<span class="menu">MOE |
      SVL</span>)</span>, type:</p>
      <p class="blockquote">
        <tt>SetRC ['carboDB', 'mypath/carbo_custom.mdb']</tt>
      </p>
      <p>Replace the filename with the full path of the custom database.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>The Carbohydrate Builder will now use
    <tt>'carbo_custom.mdb'</tt> as the carbohydrate database. Because
    this database is read-write, you may now add customized carbohydrate
    residues to it.</p>
</div>

<a id="AddingCustom"></a>
<h2>Adding Customized Residues to the Carbohydrate Database</h2>

<p>The Carbohydrate Builder uses an algorithm to number the atoms and assign,
  where possible, glycosidic links to a residue. Currently, only carbohydrate
  monosaccharide residues with the following properties may be used:</p>

<ul>
  <li>One furanose or pyranose ring system</li>
  <li>One anomeric C</li>
  <li>One anomeric O</li>
  <li>Ring carbon atoms that are all sp3 hybridized</li>
  <li>No branches directly to carbon atoms on backbone atom chains that
  extend from the anomeric or the configurational carbon</li>
  <li>Hydroxyl groups located at positions where the residue is intended to
  form links with other residues</li>
  <li>Selectable oxygen atoms must be numerically labeled</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to define the names of the oxygen atoms with their
  appropriate numeric labels, i.e. the oxygen of the -OH substituent on
  &quot;C1&quot; should be labeled as &quot;O1&quot;. If this convention is not
  followed, the functionality of the carbohydrate builder will be limited.</p>

<p>Although these conditions may seem stringent, most common monosaccharide
  and functionalized monosaccharide residues satisfy them.</p>

<div class="example">
  <a id="Example_addingCustom"></a>
  <h2>Example: Adding Custom Carbohydrates</h2>

  <p>In this example, we will add
    the highly substituted sialic acid (shown below) to the
    <tt>'carbo_custom.mdb'</tt> database created in the previous</p>

  <a href="#Examples_making_custom_carbo_mdb">example</a>.
  <img src="carbo/carbo_fig11.gif" alt="Figure 11" class="center" />

  <p>Before the structure can be added to the customized database, it must
    first be built in the MOE rendering area by using the Builder or by copying
    alpha-D-neuraminic acid (aDNeu) from the carbohydrate database and
    &quot;functionalizing&quot; it with the Builder.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Open the Carbohydrate builder with <nobr><b>MOE | Edit | Build |
    Carbohydrate</b></nobr><br /></li>
    <li>From the <b>Library</b> pulldown select <b>deoxynonulosonate</b>.
    <br /></li>
    <li>From the <b>Unit</b> pulldown select <b>aDNeu</b>.<br /></li>
    <li>Functionalize the molecule (as shown in image above) using
    <nobr><b>MOE | RHS | Builder</b></nobr><br /></li>
  </ol>

<p>At this point, note that the above structure is valid and satisfies the
    conditions listed above:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The residue contains one pyranose ring, one anomeric carbon (C2), and
    one anomeric oxygen attached to C2.</li>
    <li>The backbone carbon atoms (numbered carbon atoms in bold) number less
    than 10, and the ring carbons are all sp3 hybridized.</li>
    <li>The backbone atoms that extend from the C2 anomeric carbon (C1) and
    the configurational carbon C6 (C7-C8-C9) are not branched directly to
    carbon atoms. The 'branch' to the methoxy (-OCH3) group from the
    C8 backbone atom is acceptable, because the C8 atom is not directly
    connected to a C atom in the branch. In addition, the propyl group branch
    at C3 is also valid because the C3 atom is a ring carbon.</li>
  </ul>

<p>Once you have built the custom residue and verified that it satisfies
    the aforementioned conditions for correct recognition by the Carbohydrate
    Builder, you are ready to copy the residue to the
    <tt>'carbo_custom.mdb'</tt> database:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Open the <tt>carbo_custom.mdb</tt> database using <nobr><b>MOE |
    Open</b></nobr>.<br /></li>
    <li>Copy the custom residue from the MOE rendering area to the database
    by choosing <nobr><b>DBV | Edit | New |Entry</b></nobr> from the database
    viewer toolbar of <tt>'carbo_custom.mdb'</tt>.<br /></li>
    <li>
      <p>In the Add Database Entry panel, keep all the defaults for copying
    the molecule, and enter the following information:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>name:</b> Assign a name to the residue (optional). For this
        example, simply name the residue <tt>custom1</tt>.</li>

        <li><b>residue_name:</b> Assign an abbreviated code to the residue.
        The code may be anything, but you should avoid using codes that have
        already been assigned to other residues. The code becomes the label
        of the option menu item associated with the residue in the Carbohydrate
        Builder. For this example, type in <tt>CUST1</tt> as the residue
        name.</li>

        <li><b>class:</b> Assign a class to the residue. The class determines
        the library in which the residue will reside. For example, typing
        <tt>custom</tt> in this field will insert the residue in the
        &quot;custom&quot; library of the Carbohydrate Builder library
          pager.
        </li>

        <li><b>shape:</b> Assign a SNFG shape to the residue.  Possible
        values are: circle, square, crossed_square, divided_diamond,
        triangle, divided_triangle, rectangle, star, diamond, flat_diamond,
        hexagon and pentagon.  Since this is a Neu derivative, type
        <tt>diamond</tt>.</li>

        <li><b>color:</b> Assign a color for the SNFG shape of the residue.
        Use the <a href="../svl/fcnref/icolor.htm#icolor">icolor</a> function
        to help with this.  In this example we will make it red so type
        <tt>15863053</tt> which is the result from <tt>icolor 'red'</tt>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The remaining fields can be left blank, however they may be required
      for other applications such as carbohydrate identification.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Press <b>OK</b> to add the residue to the custom database.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>If the Carbohydrate Builder panel is currently open, close and
      re-open it to register the new custom residue. Notice that the Library
      option menu now contains the new &quot;custom&quot; library, and that the
      customized residue &quot;CUST1&quot; has a menu entry in this
      library.</p>

      <p><b>Note:</b> The above procedure does not specify what types of
      glycosidic links can be formed by this residue. The Carbohydrate
      Builder automatically recognizes the backbone atoms and the hydroxyl
      position which may potentially form glycosidic bonds. For example, the
      custom residue added in the above example has free hydroxyl groups at
      positions 2, 7 and 9, and can therefore only form glycosidic linkages
      at positions 2,7 and 9. To test this, add a standard residue to the
      system and try to link it to positions 1 to 10. The Carbohydrate
      Builder will only allow links to positions 2, 7 and 9 on the new
      residue.</p>

<p>In addition to the monosaccharides in the above list, a few other,
more exotic monosaccharides are also included in the database.
Also, many in the above list have modified forms denoted by the
following suffixes:</p>

<table class="titlebar">
  <tr>
    <th>Suffix</th>
    <th>Meaning</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>NAc</td>
    <td>N-acetyl form</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>N</td>
    <td>-amine form</td>

  <tr>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>-uronic acid form</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>6d</td>
    <td>6-deoxy form</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Prefixes and suffixes are added to the above abbreviations to denote the
  enantiomeric, anomeric and cyclic forms of a given residue:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The &quot;D&quot; and &quot;L&quot; prefixes are used to differentiate
  the D and L forms of a given monosaccharide.</li>
  <li>No suffix denotes a pyranose ring system, while the
  suffix &quot;f&quot; denotes a furanose ring system.</li>
  <li>Prefixes &quot;a&quot; (&alpha;) and &quot;b&quot; (&beta;) differentiate
  residue anomers.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, the abbreviation for the alpha form of D-glucose in a
  six-membered pyranose ring is:</p>
<p class="center">aDGlc</p>

<p>while the abbreviation for the beta form of L-allose in a furanose ring
  system is:</p>
<p class="center">bLAllf</p>

<p>This document describes the BREED application. The purpose of BREED is to
  generate novel structures from a set of aligned ligands in 3D, possibly bound
  to a common target receptor. The input geometries are assumed to be
  significant, thus new structures should preserve intramolecular orientations
  as closely as possible. The user can specify QuaSAR descriptor, Model file
  and/or Pharmacophore query filters to limit the results. If a receptor is
  present, structures can be refined in the binding cleft as with docking
  calculations. Thus, BREED can be used as part of a ligand-based or
  structure-based discovery methodology.
  <!-- ============================= METHODOLOGY -=========================== --></p>
<a id="Method"></a>
<h1>Methodology</h1>

<p>BREED takes the idea of &quot;crossover&quot; from the field of Genetic
  Algorithms to generate new structures [Pierce&nbsp;2004]. New ligands are
  generated by combining parts of existing ligands:</p>

<img src="breed/breed4.png" class="center" />

<p>with crossover points defined by all superimposed (in 3D) bond pairs:</p>

<img src="breed/breed5.png" class="center" />

<p>The highlighted bonds are considered superimposed and the right-side
  fragments are exchanged to create two new structures.</p>
<table class="noborder">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>Two bonds are considered to be superimposed if they meet the following
      criteria:</p>

      <ol start="1">
        <li><i>r<sub>1</sub></i>, the distance between terminal atoms
        A<sub>1</sub> and B<sub>1</sub> and <i>r<sub>2</sub></i>, the
        distance between terminal atoms A<sub>2</sub> and B<sub>2</sub> are
        less than <i>d<sub>cut</sub></i>, the user-specified distance
        cutoff.</li>

        <li><i>&theta;</i>, the angle between the two bonds, is less than
        <i>&theta;<sub>cut</sub></i>, the user-specified angle cutoff.</li>

      </ol>
    </td>
    <td><img src="breed/breed2.png" align="left" /></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Breeding bonds A<sub>1</sub>&ndash;B<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub>&ndash;
  B<sub>2</sub> creates two new structures: A<sub>1</sub>&ndash;B<sub>2</sub>
  and A<sub>2</sub>&ndash;B<sub>1</sub>. Atomic coordinates for the terminal
  atoms of the new bonds are generated by averaging the initial
  coordinates:</p>

<img src="breed/breed6.png" class="center" />

<p>with the new structures indicated by green and orange and the shared bond
  in purple.</p>

<p>The coordinate-averaging used by the breeding process generates
  higher-energy structures that preserve essentially all of the intermolecular
  orientation of the starting structures. In order to create lower-energy
  structures with as little global change as possible, tethered minimization
  with a variable force constant can be used:</p>

<img src="breed/breed7.png" class="center" />

<p>where <i>r</i> is the distance of each atom from the bond centroid formed
  by the four atoms of the bond pair being bred. The tether weight, <i>k</i>,
  is calculated by <i>k</i> = <i>k<sub>0</sub>r<sup>p</sup></i>, with defaults
  of 5.0 for <i>k<sub>0</sub></i> and 2 for <i>p</i>. This allows the indicated
  region near the bond centroid to relax relatively freely while preserving the
  more distant fragment geometries.</p>

<img src="breed/breed_bond.png" class="floatright" />

<p>For simplicity, BREED ignores ring and ionic (i.e.
  S<sup>+</sup>&ndash;O<sup>-</sup>) bonds. Like <i>de novo</i> design tools,
  BREED can create structures that can be difficult to synthesize. Bond
  selection can be limited to synthetically accessible bonds by applying the
  RECAP rules [Lewell&nbsp;1998] to the input structures. Bonds labeled by
  RECAP are collected into related groups, which are used to determine which
  bonds can exchange fragments. For example, the two molecules pictured here
  contain related groups (amide and ester). These share a superimposed bond
  which would thus be selected for fragment exchange.</p>

<p>If a protein structure is provided, the aligned input structures are
  assumed to define the location and extent of the binding pocket. <a href=
  "../apps/docking.htm#Example_PostDocking">Forcefield Refinement</a> can be used to
  relax each new molecule in the pocket. Sidechains can be treated flexibly
  (with or without a tether), but backbone atoms are always held fixed. This
  generates an energy score using the <a href=
  "../moe/pot.htm#Equation">Generalized Born solvation model (GB/VI)</a>
  [Labute&nbsp;2008]. This value, along with the protein coordinates if the
  sidechains were not fixed, is written to the output database. Output
  structures can also be
  <a href="../apps/docking.htm#Computational_Background">Scored</a> using
  one of the methods in MOE's <a href="../apps/docking.htm">Docking</a>
  application. If refinement is used, <a href=
  "../moe/pot.htm#Equation">MM/GBVI</a> energies are calculated for each
  protein/ligand pair.</p>

<p>BREED is implemented in MOE as a multi-step process:</p>
<ol start="1">
  <li>Generate the valid bond subset from the input structures. Determine
  candidate pairs: bonds that are the same bond order and RECAP class (if
  appropriate). Discard pairs that are not superimposed.</li>
  <li>For all superimposed candidates that contain non-redundant fragments,
  exchange those on each side of the bond and save unique structures.</li>
  <li>Filter the structures by user-specified QuaSAR descriptors, model file
  and/or pharmacophore filters. Structures failing any of these filters are
  discarded.</li>
  <li>By default, perform a short tethered minimization to generate
  low-energy structures that maintain input fragment orientations as closely
  as possible.</li>
  <li>If a protein is present, relax each structure in the cleft (with
  side-chain flexibility if desired), calculate an MM/GBVI energy, score the
  pose and calculate a fit metric.</li>
</ol>

<p>Superimposed bond pairs having identical left- or right-side fragment
  SMILES strings are ignored, as they automatically create duplicates of the
  starting structures.</p>

  one or more structure files, or select structures from open databases and
  copy them into MOE. Then issue <span class="menu">MOE | Compute | Fragments |

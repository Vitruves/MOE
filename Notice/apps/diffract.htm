<h1>
<a id="BasicDiffraction">Basic Principles of
  Diffraction</a></h1>

<p>A diffraction pattern is the image obtained from shining short-wavelength
  radiation through a material and projecting the resulting pattern onto a
  surface. The incident radiation is scattered by the atoms constituting the
  material, and the coherently scattered rays generate a unique interference
  pattern for a given crystal of a given substance.</p>

<h2><a id="Radiation">Radiation Used in Diffraction
  Studies</a></h2>

<p>Three kinds of radiation are commonly used in crystal diffraction studies:
  X-ray, electron, and neutron.</p>

<p>X-rays are scattered by the electrons, or, more specifically, by the
  electron density distributions around the nuclei of atoms. The approximate
  range of wavelengths is 0.1 to 100 angstroms, but in practice, only
  wavelengths in the range 0.5 to 3 angstroms are used. The wavelengths 0.8 to
  2.0 angstroms are of particular interest to crystallographers [Stout and
  Jensen, 1989], being on the order of inter-atomic separations and therefore
  well-suited for diffraction studies.</p>

<p>Electrons are scattered by the nuclei of atoms. The Coulombic potential of
  an atom nucleus determines an atom's electron scattering power. The
  wavelength of a beam of electrons is much shorter than that of X-rays,
  providing, in principle, a commensurately greater resolving power. Electron
  diffraction, however, requires very thin specimens and is more sensitive than
  X-rays to physical effects that reduce observed diffracted intensities.</p>

<p>Neutrons are also scattered by atom nuclei. The wavelength of neutron
  radiation is generally about 1 angstrom. There are two primary applications
  for neutron diffraction: the study of magnetic crystals (neutrons interact
  with magnetic fields whereas X-rays do not) and the study of materials
  containing light atoms (neutron scattering interaction is not proportional to
  atomic number; lighter elements may have greater scattering power than
  heavier ones).</p>

<h2><a id="XrayScattering">X-ray Scattering</a></h2>

<p>We will examine the case of X-rays, with the understanding that the
  principles apply analogously to electron and neutron diffraction.</p>

<p>When an X-ray beam impinges on a material, part of the incident power is
  scattered. The ratio of the power in the scattered beam to that in the
  incident beam is called the <em>scattering power</em> of the material. The
  intensity <i>I</i> of the scattered radiation is a function of amplitude
  <i>A</i> of the scattered radiation (<i>K</i> is some constant of
  proportionality): <!-- <span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
I = K A^2
\end{align}
</span> --></p>

<img src="diffract/math_diffract_eq0.png" class="center" />

<p>In the first approximation, we can consider X-rays as being scattered by
  point atoms, or, equivalently, by point electrons at the locations of the
  scattering atoms. The amplitude of the radiation scattered by an electron
  density distribution can then be expressed in terms of that scattered by a
  point electron, scaled by a term that is a function solely of the magnitude
  of the <em>scattering vector</em> <i><b>s</b></i>. The scattering vector is
  the vector difference between the incident ray (represented by vector
  <i><b>S</b></i><sub>0</sub>) and the associated scattered ray (represented by
  vector <i><b>S</b><sub>s</sub></i>): <!-- <span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
\textbf{s} = \textbf{S}_{s} - \textbf{S}_0
\end{align}
</span> --></p>

<img src="diffract/math_diffract_eq1.png" class="center" />

<p>This implies that the scattering intensity <i>I</i> varies with the angle
  that the scattered beam makes with respect to the incident beam. The amount
  of variance in <i>I</i> is different for each element, and is encapsulated in
  a scale factor called the <em>atom scattering factor</em>. The atom
  scattering factor describes the scattering power of an atom as a function of
  scattering angle. Using these scattering factors, an expression for the
  radiation scattered by the electron density distribution of an entire crystal
  array of atoms can be constructed.</p>

<h2><a id="AtomScatteringFactors">Atom
  Scattering Factors</a></h2>

<p>If atoms are assumed to be spherical, the scattering power of an atom is
  characterized by a scattering factor &fnof;<i><sub>a</sub></i> which is a
  function solely of element and of scattering angle, and not of the position
  of the atom. The scattering factor is expressed in terms of the scattering
  power of an equivalent number of electrons located at the position of the
  atom nucleus. At angle 0, &fnof;<i><sub>a</sub></i> is always equal to the
  total number of electrons in the atom. &fnof;<i><sub>a</sub></i> decreases as
  the angle of incidence increases, due to the destructive interference of
  radiation scattered from different parts of the electron cloud. The size of
  the electron cloud therefore has an impact on the scattering factor -- an
  atom that has a relatively diffuse cloud of electrons has a faster-decaying
  scattering factor than one with electrons more tightly bound.</p>

<p>Note: Since neutron scattering occurs at the point-like nucleus, neutron
  scattering factors are independent of scattering angle.</p>

<h2><a id="StructureFactors">Structure
  Factors</a></h2>

<p>The actual expression for the amplitude of the radiation scattered from a
  single atom <i>A</i> in a crystal unit cell, expressed in terms of that
  scattered from a single electron at the origin of the unit cell, is:
  <!-- <span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
f_{A} \textrm{e}^{2 \pi \mathrm{i} \left( \mathbf{r}_{A} \cdot \mathbf{s} \right)}
\end{align}
</span> --></p>

<img src="diffract/math_diffract_eq2.png" class="center" />

<p>where</p>
  <ul>
    <li>&fnof;<i><sub>A</sub></i> is the scattering factor of atom
    <i>A</i></li>
    <li><b>r</b><i><sub>A</sub></i> is the position vector giving the location
    of the atom</li>
    <li><i>i</i> is the complex number: <i>i</i> = &radic;(-1)</li>
    <li><b>s</b> is the scattering vector</li>
  </ul>

<p>If there are <i>N</i> atoms in the unit cell, we can write:
  <!-- <span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
F_{hkl} = \sum_{j=1}^{N} f_{j} \textrm{e}^{2 \pi \textrm{i} \left( \textbf{r}_{j} \cdot \textbf{s} \right)}
\end{align}
</span> --></p>

<img src="diffract/math_diffract_eq3.png" class="center" />

<p>The quantity <i>F<sub>hkl}</sub></i> is called the <em>structure
  factor</em>, and integers <i>h</i>, <i>k</i>, and <i>l</i> the <em>indices of
  reflection</em>. These <i>hkl</i> values are integers defined by the <a href=
  "#ScatteringGeometry">scattering geometry</a>, described below.</p>

<p>Since <i>F<sub>hkl</sub></i> is a complex exponential, we can write:
  <!-- <span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
F_{hkl} = A_{hkl} + \textrm{i} B_{hkl}
\end{align}
</span> --></p>

<img src="diffract/math_diffract_eq4.png" class="center" />

<p>where <!-- <span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{equation}
A_{hkl} = \sum_{j} f_{j} \cos \left( 2 \pi \left( h x_{j} + k y_{j} + l z_{j} \right) \right)
\end{equation}
</span> --></p>

<p> <img src="diffract/math_diffract_eq5.5.png" class="center" /></p>

<p><i>x<sub>j</sub></i>, <i>y<sub>j</sub></i>, and <i>z<sub>j</sub></i> are
  the coordinates of atoms with respect to the origin of the crystal unit
  cell.</p>

<p>The magnitude and phase of the structure factor are:
  <!-- <span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{equation}
\left| F_{hkl} \right| = \sqrt{A_{hkl}^2 + B_{hkl}^2}
\end{equation}
</span> --></p>

<p> <img src="diffract/math_diffract_eq7.png" class="center" /></p>

<p>The intensity <i>I<sub>hkl</sub></i> of a particular reflection is
  proportional to the square of the structure factor: <!-- <span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
I_{hkl} \propto F_{hkl}^{2} = A_{hkl}^2 + B_{hkl}^2
\end{align}
</span> --></p>

<img src="diffract/math_diffract_eq8.png" class="center" />

<p>where <i>F<sub>hkl</sub></i> is calculated over all atoms in the unit
  cell.</p>

<h2><a id="ScatteringGeometry">Scattering Geometry:
  Conditions for Diffraction</a></h2>

<h3><a id="BraggsEquation">Bragg's
  Equation</a></h3>

<p>X-ray diffraction by a single crystal can be cast in terms of reflections
  from regular, parallel arrays of planes within a crystal. Only under special
  conditions would the reflected radiation interfere constructively and a
  diffracted beam be observed. The required condition is that the angle of
  incidence &theta; of the incident beam obey the following relationship:
  <!-- <span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
\sin \theta = n \frac{\lambda}{2} \frac{1}{d}
\end{align}
</span> --></p>

<img src="diffract/math_diffract_eq9.png" class="center" />

<p>where</p>
  <ul>
    <li>&lambda; is the wavelength of incident radiation</li>
    <li><i>d</i> is the inter-planar spacing</li>
    <li><i>n</i> is an integer called the <em>order of diffraction</em>.</li>
  </ul>

<p>This relationship is known as <em>Bragg's equation</em>, and &theta;
  is known as the <em>Bragg angle</em>. Since the angle of reflection off a
  plane surface is equal to the angle of incidence, the Bragg angle also
  defines the scattering angle: the angle between the incident and scattered
  radiation is 2&theta;.</p>

<h3><a id="LaueEquations">Laue Equations</a></h3>

<p>Another way to look at crystal diffraction is in terms of point
  scatterers. The scattering vector <b>s</b> can be written as the vector
  difference between unit vectors lying along the directions of the incident
  and scattered (reflected) vectors, scaled by 1/&lambda;:
  <!-- <span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
\textbf{s} = \frac{\textbf{S}'_{S} - \textbf{S}'_{0}}{\lambda}
\end{align}
</span> --></p>

<img src="diffract/math_diffract_eq10.png" class="center" />

<p>The magnitude of <b>s</b> is then: <!-- <span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
\left| \textbf{s} \right| = \frac{2 \sin \theta}{\lambda}
\end{align}
</span> --></p>

<img src="diffract/math_diffract_eq11.png" class="center" />

<p>where &lambda; is the wavelength of both the incident and scattered
  radiation.</p>

<p>For a row of scatterers, spaced at vector distances <b>a</b>, constructive
  interference between the scattered rays will occur only where:
  <!-- <span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
\textbf{a} \cdot \textbf{s} = h
\end{align}
</span> --></p>

<img src="diffract/math_diffract_eq12.png" class="center" />

<p><i>h</i> is the difference, in wavelengths, between the paths of waves
  scattered by neighboring scatterers. <i>h</i> will always be an integer. No
  significant intensity will be observed except when this condition is
  satisfied.</p>

<p>Extensions to two and three dimensions follow readily. To each diffracted
  beam, a pair or triple of integers <i>hk</i> or <i>hkl</i> can be assigned.
  In three dimensions, the conditions for observed diffraction are:
  <!-- <span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{equation}
\textbf{a} \cdot \textbf{s} = h
\end{equation}</span> --></p>

<p> <img src="diffract/math_diffract_eq15.png" class="center" /></p>

<p>These conditions are known as the Laue equations.</p>

<h2><a id="ReciprocalLattice">The Reciprocal
  Lattice</a></h2>

<p>Since the Bragg approach and the Laue approach both describe the same
  phenomenon, there should be an exact relation between the two. The connection
  is that the <i>hkl</i> indices specify the Bragg reflecting planes for a
  given order of diffraction. These indices resemble <em>Miller indices</em> --
  integers used to represent directions in a crystal with reference to the
  crystallographic axes -- except that Miller indices do not have common
  factors. Indices of reflection have the common factor <i>n</i>, the order of
  diffraction.</p>

<p>Representing diffraction reflections by indices suggests that diffraction
  patterns can be expressed in terms of a lattice whose coordinates are
  <i>h</i>, <i>k</i>, and <i>l</i> It turns out that this lattice can be
  constructed by applying simple reciprocal transformations to the vectors
  <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, and <b>c</b> describing the direct crystal lattice. The
  new lattice is called the <em>reciprocal lattice</em>. Its points represent
  all the possible reflecting conditions, each of which can be associated with
  a structure factor.</p>

<p>The reciprocal lattice is specified by reciprocal lattice vectors
  <b>a</b><sup>*</sup>, <b>b</b><sup>*</sup>, and <b>c</b><sup>*</sup>, defined
  in the following way: <!-- <span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{r l r l r l}
      \textbf{a} \cdot \textbf{a}^{*} & = 1
    & \textbf{a} \cdot \textbf{b}^{*} & = 0
    & \textbf{a} \cdot \textbf{c}^{*} & = 0
\\
      \textbf{b} \cdot \textbf{a}^{*} & = 0
    & \textbf{b} \cdot \textbf{b}^{*} & = 1
    & \textbf{b} \cdot \textbf{c}^{*} & = 0
\\
      \textbf{c} \cdot \textbf{a}^{*} & = 0
    & \textbf{c} \cdot \textbf{b}^{*} & = 0
    & \textbf{c} \cdot \textbf{c}^{*} & = 1
        \end{array}
\end{equation}
</span> --></p>

<img src="diffract/math_diffract_eq16.png" class="center" />

<p>The scattering vector <b>s</b> can be conveniently expressed in terms of
  the reciprocal lattice vectors as: <!-- <span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
\textbf{s} = h \textbf{a}^{*} + k \textbf{b}^{*} + l \textbf{c}^{*}
\end{align}
</span> --></p>

<img src="diffract/math_diffract_eq17.png" class="center" />

<p>which clearly satisfies the Laue equations. If we introduce
  <b>d</b><i><sub>hkl</sub></i>, the distance vector between reflection planes,
  into the Laue equations, we obtain: <!-- <span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
\textbf{s} = \textbf{d}_{hkl} / d_{hkl}^2
\end{align}
</span> --></p>

<img src="diffract/math_diffract_eq18.png" class="center" />

<p>The magnitude of <b>s</b> is: <!-- <span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
\left| \textbf{s} \right| =  1 / d_{hkl}
\end{align}
</span> --></p>

<img src="diffract/math_diffract_eq19.png" class="center" />

<p>In other words, the magnitude of the scattering vector is the inverse of
  the direct lattice inter-planar spacing. Putting this back into Bragg's
  equation, we obtain the following simple relationship that provides an easy
  test for determining whether a reciprocal lattice point is a potential source
  of diffraction: <!-- <span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
\left| \textbf{s} \right| =  \frac{2 \sin \theta}{\lambda} \le \frac{2}{\lambda}
\end{align}
</span> --></p>

<img src="diffract/math_diffract_eq20.png" class="center" />

<p>The inequality merely expresses the fact that the magnitude of (sin
  &theta;) must be less than or equal to 1.</p>

<h2><a id="GeneralCorrectionFactors">General
  Correction Factors</a></h2>

<p>Diffraction intensity of a particular reflection is calculated from the
  square of the associated structure factor. To be able to make a meaningful
  comparison to experimentally observed values, terms must be included to
  account for various physical aspects of diffraction.</p>

<h3><a id="TemperatureFactors">Temperature
  Factors</a></h3>

<p>Atoms are not stationary. They possess thermal energy and are in constant
  oscillation. The resultant effect is that atom scattering factors fall off
  faster with diffraction angle than in the stationary model since the atom
  electron clouds are effectively spread over a larger volume of space.</p>

<p>To correct for thermal motion, the following temperature factor correction
  is applied to each scattering factor: <!-- <span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
\textrm{e}^{-B \sin^{2} \theta / \lambda^2}
\end{align}
</span> --></p>

<img src="diffract/math_diffract_eq21.png" class="center" />

<p>If atom oscillation is assumed to be isotropic (the same in all
  directions), <em>B</em>, the <em>Debye-Waller factor</em>, is proportional to
  the isotropic mean-square amplitude of atom vibration:
  <!-- <span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
B = 8 \pi^2 \left< u^2 \right>
\end{align}
</span> --></p>

<img src="diffract/math_diffract_eq22.png" class="center" />

<p>where <i>u</i> is the amplitude of vibration (more specifically, it is the
  projection of the atom position vector onto the scattering vector <b>s</b>.
  Angle brackets denote a quantum statistical mechanical average.</p>

<p>If global anisotropic temperature factors are used, the mean-squared
  amplitudes of oscillation are required in three directions; for convenience,
  the directions can be expressed with reference to the direct lattice axes
  <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, and <b>c</b>. The term &quot;global&quot;, when referring
  to temperature factors, implies that the temperature factors apply to all
  atoms, regardless of element.</p>

<p>More precise temperature factor correction requires atom temperature
  factors --- temperature factors which depend on atom element.</p>

<h3><a id="LorentzGeometricCorrection">Lorentz Geometric Correction</a></h3>

<p>Diffraction data collection usually involves a crystal rotating through a
  stationary beam of incident radiation. When a crystal is rotated, different
  planes of the crystal present themselves in their reflecting orientations at
  different rates, with result that reflections with small Bragg angles and
  with large Bragg angles are enhanced. The <em>Lorentz factor</em> is used to
  correct intensity values for this effect: <!-- <span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
L = \frac{1}{\sin 2 \theta}
\end{align}
</span> --></p>

<img src="diffract/math_diffract_eq23.png" class="center" />

<p>In the case of fiber samples, a modified correction factor has been
  proposed by de Wolff [de Wolff, 1962] to account for fiber texture:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Equatorial reflections (i.e. radial): <!-- <span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
L = 8 \pi \sin^{2} \theta \cos \theta
\end{align}
</span> -->
     <img src="diffract/math_diffract_eq24.png" /></li>
    <li>Diatropic reflections (i.e. axial): <!-- <span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
L = 8 \pi t \sin^{2} \theta \cos \theta

<h2><a id="XrayCorrectionFactors">X-ray
  Correction Factors</a></h2>

<h3><a id="PolarizationCorrection">Polarization
  Correction</a></h3>

<p>The efficiency of X-ray reflection varies with the angle of reflection.
  When unpolarized X-ray radiation strikes a reflecting plane, the component
  parallel to the plane is fully reflected while that perpendicular to the
  plane is reduced in amplitude by the cosine of the reflection angle. To
  correct for this effect, the following polarization factor for unpolarized
  radiation can be used: <!-- <span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
p = \frac{1 + \cos^{2} 2 \theta}{2}
\end{align}
</span> --></p>

<img src="diffract/math_diffract_eq28.png" class="center" />

<p>This term is independent of the method of data collection except if a
  crystal monochromator is used. When using a crystal monochromator, the
  resultant X-ray beam is partly polarized. For partly polarized radiation, the
  polarization correction factor can be expressed as: <!-- <span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
p = \frac{P + K \cos^{2} 2 \theta}{P + K}
\end{align}
</span> --></p>

<img src="diffract/math_diffract_eq29.png" class="center" />

<p>where</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <i>K</i> is the ratio of the power of the perpendicular to the parallel
      components in the monochromatized beam, and can be approximated as:
      <!-- <span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
\cos^4 2 \theta_{m}
\end{align}
</span> -->
       <img src="diffract/math_diffract_eq30.png" />

<p>where &theta;<i><sub>m</sub></i> is the Bragg angle of the strongly
      reflecting planes in the monochromatizing crystal.</p>
    </li>
    <li><i>P</i> accounts for the degree of polarization of the X-ray beam,
    given as the fractional amount of the parallel component in the beam.</li>
  </ul>

<p>When using X-ray radiation, the Lorentz factor is commonly combined with
  the polarization correction factor. Together they are referred to as the
  <i>L<sub>p</sub></i> correction factor.</p>

<h3><a id="AnomalousScattering">Anomalous
  Scattering</a></h3>

<p>The scattering theory behind the diffraction model described in this
  chapter (Thomson scattering) assumes that the frequency of incident radiation
  differs significantly from that of the natural absorption frequencies of
  electrons in the diffracting atoms. For electrons closest to the nucleus (K
  electrons), however, this assumption is generally violated. Anomalous phase
  changes occur on scattering, i.e. the phase and amplitude of the scattered
  wave is modified from that expected under Thomson scattering assumptions. To
  account for this, atom scattering factors are corrected by a complex term
  that describes the modification. <!-- <span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
f = f_{0} + f' + f''
\end{align}
</span> --></p>

<img src="diffract/math_diffract_eq31.png" class="center" />

<p>The correction terms are effectively independent of scattering angle.</p>

<h2><a id="DataCollection">Data Collection</a></h2>

<h3><a id="SampleTypes">Sample Types</a></h3>

<p>Some compounds can be made to crystallize into sizeable single crystals,
  others can be obtained only as powders. Some materials have an oriented
  texture, such as fibrous materials.</p>

<p>Diffraction patterns from single crystals are arrays of sharp spots.
  Powder samples are composed of many tiny crystallites of all orientations.
  Thus, instead of single diffracted beams being generated for a given Bragg
  angle, a family of beams is generated, all lying on a cone with semi-angle
  2&theta;; the image obtained is then a series of concentric circles. Fiber
  samples comprise crystallites strongly oriented in a given direction, and so
  generate a picture that is somewhere in between that from single crystals and
  that from powders.</p>

<p>Powder crystallites may exhibit a propensity to orient in a particular
  direction. If there is a preferred orientation, correction factors can be
  introduced to account for it. There are several different kinds of
  corrections that can be made, two of which described here.</p>

<p>The <em>March-Dollase</em> preferred-orientation correction characterizes
  the strength of the preferred orientation of crystallites using the March
  variable <i>R</i>: <!-- <span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
\left( R^{2} \cos^{2} \alpha + R^{-1} \sin^{2} \alpha \right)^{-\frac{3}{2}}
\end{align}
</span> --></p>

<img src="diffract/math_diffract_eq32.png" class="center" />

<p>This variable is defined differently for different crystal morphologies.
  For platy crystallites, <i>R</i> is defined to be <i>d / d</i><sub>0</sub>,
  while for needle-like crystallites it is defined to be the inverse,
  <i>d</i><sub>0</sub> / <i>d</i>. <i>d</i><sub>0</sub> is the hypothetical
  thickness of the uncompacted/unextended sample, and <i>d</i> is the sample
  thickness after axial compaction or extension. <i>R</i> = 1.0 implies no
  preferred orientation.</p>

<p>The <em>Rietveld-Toraya</em> method uses a Gaussian expression to model
  the effects of preferred orientation: <!-- <span class='LaTeX'>
\begin{align}
G_{2} + \left( 1 - G_{2} \right) \textrm{e}^{-G_{1} \alpha^2}
\end{align}
</span> --></p>

<img src="diffract/math_diffract_eq33.png" class="center" />

<p><i>G</i><sub>1</sub> = 0 or <i>G</i><sub>2</sub> = 1 implies no preferred
  orientation.</p>

<h3><a id="Cameras">Cameras</a></h3>

<p>The reciprocal lattice represents a full three-dimensional diffraction
  pattern. When recording a diffraction pattern, however, only a projection of
  the data can be captured, and information may be lost. Peaks in the
  diffraction pattern may overlap and become unresolvable. For powder samples,
  the diffraction data is effectively reduced to one-dimension: at each Bragg
  angle a peak is observed, the height of which is the sum of the intensities
  of all <i>hkl</i> reflections of that angle. For single crystal and fiber
  samples, overlaps can still occur. Moving-film techniques have been developed
  to eliminate spot coincidence in 2-D diffraction patterns.</p>

<p>Powder samples are commonly recorded using either a strip of film within a
  cylindrical camera setting, or a diffractometer that counts the number of
  X-ray photons.</p>

<p>There are many 2-D diffraction cameras, including flat plate, cylindrical
  film, precession, and Weissenberg. Flat plate and cylindrical film methods
  involve a stationary recording medium in either a planar configuration or a
  cylinder surrounding the sample configuration. Precession and Weissenberg
  imaging techniques are more complicated as they require a moving photographic
  film cartridge. They offer, however, a means for photographing diffraction
  patterns without overlapped spots. The Buerger precession method is
  particularly valuable as it provides an undistorted projection of the
  reciprocal lattice. Its chief disadvantage is that it records less of
  reciprocal space than does, for instance, the Weissenberg camera.</p>

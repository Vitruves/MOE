<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
The Spectral Analysis application supports computational studies of NMR,
IR, VCD, UV, ECD and ORD spectra for small molecules and peptides.  In addition, chemical
shift, coupling constant and/or pairwise distance data can be used to
determine the relative populations within a set of conformers, yielding the
in-solution conformer distribution.  This information can be used for
compound analysis as well as for understanding the energetics of binding.
</p>

<p>
NMR spectroscopy measures the magnetic properties of atomic nuclei, and
can reveal detailed information about molecular structure. On the NMR
Analysis page, NMR shielding tensors and spin-spin coupling constants
(<b><i>J</i></b>) calculated by a quantum mechanical program [Bally&nbsp;2011]
can
be converted into chemical shifts, which can be displayed and (automatically)
matched to experimental data.</p>

<p>Vibrational Circular Dichroism (VCD) measures the differential infrared
  (IR) spectrum produced with left&ndash; and right&ndash;circularly polarized
  light as it interacts with vibrational transitions in a molecule
  [Stephens&nbsp;1985, Dukor&nbsp;2000, Vargek&nbsp;1997]. Chiral centers will
  exhibit optical activity in the IR range analogous to that seen in other
  types of spectra such as polarimetry. Calculating the VCD response involves
  determining the dipolar response of the perturbed Hamiltonian (&#x210B;')
  due to the incident electric (<b><i>E</i></b>) and magnetic (<b><i>H</i></b>)
  fields according to<br /></p>

<p class="center">&#x210B;'(<b><i>E</i></b>,<b><i>H</i></b>) =
  -(<i><b>&mu;</b><sub>el</sub> <b>&middot;</b> <b>E</b></i>)
  (<i><b>&mu;</b><sub>mag</sub> <b>&middot;</b> <b>H</b></i>).</p>

<p>
These calculations require that both the polarizability and magnetic
shielding tensors be calculated, which is handled by third-party quantum
mechanics (QM) software.
</p>

<p>Electronic Circular Dichroism (ECD) measures the differential Ultraviolet
  (UV) spectrum produced with left&ndash; and right&ndash;circularly polarized
  light as it interacts with electronic transitions in a molecule
  [Trander&nbsp;2017]. Calculating the ECD involves modeling 
  excited electron states using time-dependent density functional theory.
</p>

<p>Optical rotation is the rotation of the orientation of the plane 
   of polarization of linearly polarized light as it travels through certain materials.
   It occurs as a consequence of different refractive indices for left and
   right circularly polarized light. Optical rotation dispersion (ORD) measures
   the dependence of optical rotation on wavelength. Quantum mechanics
   computation of ORD does not involve time dependent DFT and may be faster
   than the computation of ECD. Experimentally ORD is measured at a given wavelength,
   and to compute it in MOE a set of wavelength values must be specified.
</p>

<p>
   ECD and ORD are related by the Kramers–Kronig transformation [Polavarapu&nbsp;2006].
   If experimental ECD data is available the Spectral Analysis application 
   transforms it to ORD using the Kramers–Kronig transformation.
   The transformation from molar ellipticity [&theta;(&mu;)]
   (as a function of wavelength) to the molar rotation [&phi;(&lambda;] is given by
   <img src="spectralanalysis/KKeq1.png" class="center" alt=
  "KK1" />
   Usually ECD is expressed as molar circular dichroism &epsilon;.
   Mollar ellipticity  [&theta;] is given by 3298.2 * &epsilon;.
   And ORD, expressed as specific rotation, is given by [&phi;] * 100 / molar mass.
   The integral on the right side has a singularity and to overcome this problem the 
   method suggested by Ohta and Ishida [Ohta&nbsp;1988] is utilized, as folllows
   <img src="spectralanalysis/KKeq2.png" class="center" alt="KK1" />
   The summation on the right uses alternate data points to avoid the singularity 
   at &lambda; = &mu;: if the wavelength &lambda; where the molar rotation
   is to be calculated corresponds to an odd-numbered data point, 
   then the summation is carried over even-numbered data points.
</p> 

<p>
Experimental information for a chemical structure can be estimated by
generating a set of conformers and constructing a weighted sum of the
appropriate calculated property:

<p class="center"><i><b>p</b><sub>calc</sub></i> =
<b>&Sigma;</b><sub><i>i</i></sub> <i><b>w</b><sub>i</sub></i>
<i><b>p</b></i><sub><i>i</i></sub>,
</p>

where <i><b>w</b><sub>i</sub></i> is the weight and
<i><b>p</b><sub>i</sub></i> is the
calculated property for conformer <i>i</i>.  The best-fitting set of
conformers can be determined by calculating the weights via a least-squares
fit to a penalty function, <b><i>&Chi;</i></b><sup>2</sup>:

<p class="center">
<i><b>&Chi;</b></i><sup>2</sup> =
<b>&Sigma;</b><sub><i>j</i></sub> ((<i><b>J</b><sub>exp,j</sub></i> -
<i><b>J</b><sub>calc,j</sub></i>) /
<i><b>&sigma;</b><sub>J,j</sub></i>)<sup>2</sup> +
<b>&Sigma;</b><sub><i>j</i></sub> ((<i><b>r</b><sub>exp,j</sub></i> -
<i><b>r</b><sub>calc,j</sub></i>) /
<i><b>&sigma;</b><sub>r,j</sub></i>)<sup>2</sup> +
<b>&Sigma;</b><sub><i>j</i></sub> ((<i><b>&delta;</b><sub>exp,j</sub></i> -
<i><b>&delta;</b><sub>calc,j</sub></i>) /
<i><b>&sigma;</b><sub>&delta;,j</sub></i>)<sup>2</sup>,
</p>

where <i>j</i> refers to the individual experimental (and calculated)
measurements and the denominators, <i><b>&sigma;</b><sub>p,j</sub></i>,
are the errors associated with individual measurements of type
<i><b>p</b></i>.

<p>
Currently, MOE supports Gaussian 09 and Gaussian 16 for QM calculations.
Conformers can be generated by either forcefield or QM-based methods.

<h1>NMR Analysis</h1>
<a id="ReferenceMethod"></a>
<h2>Reference Method</h2>

<p>Calculated isotropic shielding constants, &sigma;, can be converted to
  chemical shifts, &delta;, by a number of Reference Methods. We will use
  <sup>13</sup>C
  NMR as an example, but any atom that has a calculated shielding and a
  Reference Method can be used. As with experiment, the <sup>13</sup>C
  chemical shift can
  be obtained by subtracting the isotropic shielding constants for the carbon
  nuclei in the molecule of interest, {&sigma;<sub><i>i</i></sub>}, from those
  of tetramethylsilane (TMS), &sigma;<sub>ref</sub>:</p>

<p class="center">&delta;<sub><i>i</i></sub> = &sigma;<sub>ref</sub> -
  &sigma;<sub><i>i</i></sub></p>

<p>While there can be significant errors with any calculation, using the same
  QM parameters for both will likely reduce them. Thus, chemical shifts
  calculated in this way often benefit from cancellation of errors.</p>

<p>Alternate reference compounds can be chosen that are more similar to the
  molecules being studied. This can result in improved results due to greater
  cancellation of errors. If the experimental chemical shift for the reference
  compound is known, the isotropic shielding constants can be converted into
  chemical shifts relative to TMS:</p>

<p class="center">&delta;<sub><i>i</i></sub> = &sigma;<sub>ref</sub> -
  &sigma;<sub><i>i</i></sub> + &delta;<sub>ref</sub></p>

<p>where &delta;<sub><i>i</i></sub> is the chemical shift relative to TMS,
  &sigma;<sub>ref</sub> is the computed shielding constant for the reference
  molecule, &sigma;<sub><i>i</i></sub> is the computed shielding constant for
  the nuclei in the molecule of interest and &delta;<sub>ref</sub> is the
  experimental chemical shift for the reference compound. A logical extension
  to using a single reference compound is to use one reference for
  sp<sup>3</sup>-hybridized carbons and a different reference for sp- and
  sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridized carbons. Typically, methanol is used for saturated
  and benzene is used for unsaturated atoms. In the case of hydrogens, the
  hybridization of the adjacent carbon is used.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the reference compound(s) can be replaced by linear
  regression models constructed from sets of compounds. If a large set of data
  is used, the effect of mismatch between calculated and experimental chemical
  shifts for any single compound is reduced. As above, all calculations must be
  performed with the same QM parameters. The chemical shift can be calculated
  by:</p>

<p class="center">&delta;<sub><i>i</i></sub> = (<tt>intercept</tt> -
  &sigma;<sub><i>i</i></sub>) / &minus;<tt>slope</tt></p>

<p>Slope/intercept values can be tabulated for sets of molecules and QM
  parameters; the <a href="http://cheshirenmr.info/index.htm">CHESHIRE chemical
  shift repository</a> provides one such example [Lodewyk&nbsp;2011].</p>
<a id="ReferenceData"></a>
<h2>Reference Data</h2>

<p>Calculated isotropic shielding constants are converted into chemical
  shifts by applying a transformation rule that is dependent on the QM
  parameters used for the calculation. These Reference Methods are collected
  into a MOE database, where each entry specifies the QM parameters (method,
  basis set, solvent model and solvent), the element, a transformation rule and
  a description that appears in the <b>Method</b> menu of the NMR Analysis
  panel. A sample portion of a Reference Database is provided below:</p>

<img src="spectralanalysis/refsample.png" class="center" alt=
  "Sample Reference Database" />
  <table class="noborder">
    <tr>
      <td><b>Description</b></td>
      <td>This is a description of the Reference Method defined in
      the database entry. Examples are <b>TMS</b>, indicating that
      tetramethylsilane is used as a reference, <span class="nobr"><b>Linear
      Scaling</b></span>, indicating that a regression model relates shielding
      to chemical shifts and <span class="nobr"><b>Two Reference</b></span>,
      indicating that one model is used for saturated atoms and another for
      unsaturated atoms. These appear in the <b>Method</b> menu of NMR
      Analysis.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>QM&nbsp;Method</b></td>
      <td>This is the QM method used to calculate the isotropic
      shielding constants. Typical methods would be a DFT method such as B3LYP,
      Hartree-Fock (HF) or post-Hartree-Fock methods such as MP2.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Basis&nbsp;Set</b></td>
      <td>This is the complete description of the basis set used
      to calculate the isotropic shielding constants.</td>

      isotropic shielding constants. If omitted, a gas-phase calculation was
      performed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Solvent</b></td>
      <td>This is the solvent used (with the above mentioned
      Solvent Model) used to calculate the isotropic shielding constants. It
      can be the name of a solvent supported by the external QM program or the
      value of the dielectric constant that was used. If omitted, a gas-phase
      calculation was performed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Element</b></td>
      <td>The atomic symbol of the element the Reference Method
      applies to. In this case carbon, indicated by <b>C</b>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Transform</b></td>
      <td>This specifies the one or two algebraic transformations
      used to convert the calculated isotropic shielding constant into a
      chemical shift. <b>x</b> is the value of the chemical shielding and the
      result is the chemical shift. When two transformations are used, they
      must be separated by a semicolon. The first equation is used for
      saturated atoms and the second is used for unsaturated atoms. All
      equations must be valid SVL expressions.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

<p>Ideally, all entries in a Reference Database should be unique. If
  redundant entries are present, NMR Analysis will use the first matching entry
  to calculate chemical shifts. If, for example, multiple regression models are
  available for a particular set of QM parameters, the Description field must
  be used to differentiate them. Note that the QM parameters are set when QM
  Refinement is performed in <span class="nobr"><b>Conformational
  Search</b></span>, which writes them to the output database.

      Setting <b>View</b> to Shift shows the
      calculated chemical shifts (in black) and the chemical shifts read from
      the from the Experimental Data file (in <font color="blue">blue</font>).
      As calculated and experimental peaks have been associated, a graphical
      representation of the Delta column of the Atom list is provided in
      <font color="red">red</font> (the empirical correction is applied if
      present). As above, a single entry in the Atom List is selected, and the
      corresponding chemical shift is highlighted. The scroll wheel can be used
      to zoom or translate the Shift plot.<br />
      <br />
      The <b>Display</b> checkboxes control what chemical shift values are
      shown. If <b>Calculated</b> is on, calculated chemical shifts will be
      shown. If <font color="blue">Experimental</font> is on, experimental
      chemical shifts will be shown. If a single experimental chemical shift is
      selected in the plot, its value will be shown.

      <img src="spectralanalysis/delta.png" class="center" alt=
      "Delta Plot" />

      Setting
      <b>View</b> to Delta shows the difference values (Delta) between
      experimental and calculated chemical shifts (the empirical correction is
      applied if present). In this case, there are seven experimental/calculated
      chemical shift associations with errors ranging from roughly 7 to 15.
      The Label associated with each row of the Atom List is included
      with each histogram column. Selecting entries in the Delta plot will
      select (or highlight) the appropriate entries in the Atom List and 2D
      Depiction.

      <img src="spectralanalysis/absdelta.png" class="center" alt=
      "Absolute Delta Plot" />

      Setting <b>View</b> to Abs Delta shows the
      absolute Delta values between experimental and calculated chemical shifts
      (the empirical correction is applied if present). This uses the data in
      the above plot, with positive Deltas for all histogram entries.</td>

        the database, the NMR Analysis application panel will be shown.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p><i>Specify the Reference Database.</i></p>
      <p>The default Reference Database is <tt>$MOE/lib/NMR_ref.mdb</tt>. To
      select a different database, press <b>Browse</b> and in the Open panel,
      select the database that will be used.</p>

        <p><i>Specify the Experimental Data.</i></p>
	<p>If the Chemical Shifts text field is empty, press

        panel, select
        <tt>$MOE/sample/mol/p_cresol_data.txt</tt> and press <b>OK</b>. At this
        point, the NMR Analysis panel should look like this:</p>

	<img src= "spectralanalysis/panel_ex1_1.png" class="center" alt=
        "Ex 1 Initial Panel" />

	<p>In the Atom List, the Shielding column
        (offscreen to the right) contains the calculated isotropic shielding
        constants read from the input database. The Calc column contains the
        calculated chemical shifts obtained by applying the Reference Model
        (TMS) to the shielding values. The Expt and Delta columns
        are empty because no pairing of experimental and calculating data has
        been performed. The Corr and Corr&nbsp;Calc columns are empty because no
        empirical corrections have been entered.</p>

<p>The atoms in the 2D Depiction are labeled by the Label column of the
        Atom List, which defaults to the atom name in the mol field of the
        input database. The plot shows the calculated chemical shifts (in
        black) and the experimental chemical shifts (in <font color=
        "blue">blue</font>). When a row is selected in the Atom List, the
        corresponding atom in the 2D Depiction and the plot is
        highlighted.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p><i>Assign atoms to Experimental Data.</i></p>
      <p>Select the last atom in the atom list (roughly 125 ppm) and select the
      smallest entry in the <b>Expt&nbsp;Data</b> option menu (roughly 20 ppm).
      This is a mismatch, which will generate a large Delta. Select the third
      atom in the atom list and the similar-value entry in the option menu
      (both roughly 155). This is a match with a small Delta. Select both
      entries in the Atom List; the NMR Analysis panel should look like this:
      </p>

      <img src="spectralanalysis/panel_ex1_2.png" class="center" alt=
      "Ex 1 Partial Panel 1" />

      <p>Note that the radius of the selection marks on
      the 2D depiction corresponds to the values of the Delta column, as do the
      representations of the absolute Delta on the Shift plot. The dark ring on
      the larger circle indicates that the actual value is larger than the
      maximum radius value. Two rows in the Atom List are selected, so two
      calculated and two experimental chemical shifts are highlighted in the
      Shift plot. As the experimental/calculated shift associations were
      assigned manually, they are marked with a <tt>*</tt>.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p><i>Label individual atoms in the Atom List.</i></p>
      <p>Select the third entry in the Atom List, enter <tt>C1</tt> in the
      <b>Label</b> text field and press <b>Apply</b>. This changes the label
      for the third atom. Repeat this process to change the label of the fifth
      atom to <tt>C2</tt>. Note that the labels of the 2D Depiction change as
      the Labels are changed.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p><i>Enter an empirical correction</i></p>
      <p>Select the third entry in the Atom List, enter <tt>10.0</tt> in the
      <b>Correction</b> text field and press <b>Apply</b>. The correction
      appears in the appropriate column of the selected entry, which defines
      the <b>Corr&nbsp;Calc</b> column value. Adding the correction decreases
      the <b>Delta</b> column value.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><i>Automatically assign atoms to Experimental Data.</i></p>
        <p>Press <b>Reset Assignments</b> to clear the two manual assignments,
	and
        press <span class="nobr"><b>Auto-Assign</b></span> to automatically
        associate calculated and experimental chemical shifts with minimum
        Delta. The absolute Delta representations on the Shift plot are now
        quite small, and reflect the presence of the empirical correction. The
        magnitude of the Delta values can be easily seen by changing
        <b>View</b> to Delta to display a histogram plot:</p>

        <img src="spectralanalysis/histo_ex1_1.png" class="center" alt=
        "Ex 1 Delta Plot" />
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><i>Examine alternate structures.</i></p>
        <p>Press the <img class="icon" src="spectralanalysis/icon_structure.png"
        alt="Structure Icon"> (Structure) icon to display the 2D depictions of
        each structure
        in the input database. As the number of experimental peaks is less than
        the number of carbon atoms, some of them must share chemical shifts or
        be magnetically equivalent. Pick the third structure, p-cresol, as it
        is the only symmetric structure. Change plot <b>View</b> to Shift to
        show the calculated and experimental chemical shifts. The NMR Analysis
        panel should now look like this:</p>

        <img src="spectralanalysis/panel_ex1_3.png" class="center" alt=
        "Ex 1 o-cresol Display" />
      </li>
      <li><p><i>Automatically assign atoms to Experimental Data</i></p>
      <p>Press <b>Auto-Assign</b> to automatically associate calculated and
      experimental chemical shifts with minimum Delta. Carbons in the 2 and 6
      positions and the 3 and 5 positions of the phenyl ring are topologically
      equivalent. As their calculated chemical shieldings are quite similar
      (much less than the 5 ppm cutoff), they are considered magnetically
      equivalent and the same experimental chemical shift is assigned to both
      atoms of each pair. The chemical shifts group well on the Shift plot and
      all Delta values are small, suggesting that <i>p-</i>cresol corresponds
      to the experimental shifts.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><i>Analyze elements other than carbon.</i></p>
        <p>Change <b>Element</b> to <b>H</b> to analyze the hydrogen atoms of
        p-cresol. As experimental results are tied to individual elements,
        changing the element clears the previously loaded information. There is
        an entry for hydrogen in the default Reference Database, so calculated
        chemical shifts are available. The panel should look like this:</p>

<img src="spectralanalysis/panel_ex1_4.png" class="center" alt=
        "Ex 1 o-cresol H Display" />

	<p>Note that hydrogens have appeared in
        the 2D display. They will also appear when examining coupling constants
        for all atoms.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><i>Analyze Coupling Constants.</i></p>
        <p>NMR spin-spin coupling constants (<b>J</b>) are calculated as a
	matrix
        of values, expressing the coupling of each atom with the other atoms in
        the molecule. The coupling constants can be visualized for individual
        atoms by selecting one of the atoms in the Atom List and changing the
        <b>Coupling</b> menu to either the same-element (<b>H-H</b> in this
        case) or <b>All</b>. If we select the hydrogen labeled <tt>H1</tt>, and
        select <b>H-H</b> the following depiction shows the couplings with that
        atom:</p>

<img src="spectralanalysis/panel_ex1_5.png" class="center" alt=
        "Ex 1 o-cresol H Coupling" />

	<p>Positive values for <b>J</b> are
        represented in blue, negative values in orange and the size of the disk
        is proportional to the value (in Hz). The ring around the central carbon
        indicates that the actual value is larger than that of the maximum
        radius. The specific values of the coupling constants can be seen by
        selecting <tt>Coupling</tt> in the <b>View</b> menu. If Boltzmann
        weighting is turned off, a similar scheme is used to color the atoms of
        the conformer shown in MOE. Pressing the <b>Table</b> button brings up
        a table containing the full matrix of <b>J</b> values:</p>

<img src="spectralanalysis/table_ex1_1.png" class="center" alt=
        "Ex 1 o-cresol J Table" />

	<p>Hydrogen <tt>H1</tt> is selected in the
        Atom List, so its entry in the table is highlighted with an asterisk.
        As with the other displays in NMR Analysis, the display is synced to
        the settings of the panel, reflecting the current structure, conformer,
        etc. If the atom labels are not sufficient to identify rows in the
        table, the atom indices can be shown in the 2D display by setting the
        <b>View</b> menu to <b>Index</b>.</p>

    <p>The initial correlation is 0.304, indicating that there is a mismatch

    </p>

    <p>
    Note that the Spectral Correlation has increased to 0.797 and the resulting
    Offset is 11.5 wavenumbers.  The Offset slider can be used to dynamically
    shift the calculated spectra to higher or lower wavenumbers, changing the
    correlation as the Offset is adjusted.  The display can be zoomed
    and/or translated via the mouse scroll wheel, with the spectra
    autoscaling as the plot is changed.  Press

    <p>
    <span class="nobr"><b>Auto-Align</b></span> can be pressed to determine

    <p>
    <img src="spectralanalysis/ESITableEx.png" class="center"

    </p>

    <p>Looking at the table, the Spectral Correlations are 0.888 for RR
    and -0.860
    for SS.  This results in an (off-diagonal) ESI value of 1.748 which suggests
    that this example can differentiate between the two chiral classes for
    camphor.

<!-- ======================== CONFORMER DISTRIBUTION ===================== !-->

<a id="FITAnalysis"></a>
<h1>Conformer Distribution Methodology Overview</h1>

<p>An important application of NMR and NOE studies is the elucidation
of dominant conformers of a compound in solution.  Knowledge of the
dominant conformers can be used to understand and optimize the
compound's biological activity.  The population distribution of
individual conformers, and thus the dominant solution conformations, can
be determined by comparing calculated to known experimental values
[Navarro-Vazquez&nbsp;2018], and then finding the distribution of
conformers that yields the best agreement with the experimental
measurements.</p>

<p>
A set of conformers can be computationally generated for a compound
via forcefield or QM-based methods based on structure and energetics.
Calculated measurements can then be obtained for every conformer through
simulation: pairwise distances can be obtained via classical or quantum
chemical methods, while chemical shifts and coupling constants can be
calculated via quantum chemical simulation.
</p>

<p>The problem of finding a compound's conformer population distribution
can be cast as a Least Squares Error optimization, in which the sum of
squared residuals &ndash; differences between weighted calculated values
and experimentally measured values &ndash; is minimized over all
conformations by adjusting the weights.  Measurement error is taken into
account to reduce the impact of less reliable measurements, and
experimental measurement distance bias is alleviated by applying
vibrational analysis.</p>

<p>The simulation protocol is as follows:</p>

<img src="spectralanalysis/conformer_simulation_protocol.png" class="center"
    alt="Conformer Distribution Simulation Protocol" />

<h3>Least Squares Error Optimization</h3>

<p>The Least Squares method used in the Conformer Distribution
application seeks to minimize the overall difference or <i>error</i>
between the experimental measurements and a weighted average of the
simulated measurements.  The weights in this weighted average represent
each conformer's contribution to the simulated measurement values, and
are meant to reflect the relative proportion of each conformer expressed
within the in-solution conformer population.  When the weights
accurately reflect the true conformer distribution, the observed
(experimental) measurement should in principle correspond closely with
the simulated weighted-average values.</p>

<p>The objective function of the optimization, the score
<i><b>F</b></i>, is composed of three terms, one for each of the NMR
shift <i>I</i>, NOE distance <i>&delta;</i>, and J-coupling
measurements, respectively.  When a particular type of measurement data
is not available, the corresponding term is omitted from the
expression.</p>

<img src="spectralanalysis/conformer_least_squares_fit.png" class="center"
    alt="Conformer Distribution Least Squares" />

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
  <li><i>N<sub>i</sub></i>, <i>N<sub>&delta;</sub></i>,
    and <i>N<sub>J</sub></i> are the number of experimental observations;
  </li>
  <li>The asterisk (*) indicates experimental values;
  </li>
  <li>The &sigma; values are the experimental error;
  </li>
  <li><i>I<sub>i</sub></i>, <i>&delta;<sub>i</sub></i>,
    and <i>J<sub>i</sub></i> are the calculated NOE intensity,
    chemical shift, and coupling constants, respectively, given as follows:
  </li>
</ul>

<img src="spectralanalysis/conformer_weighted_averages.png" class="center"
    alt="Calculate shift term" />

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
  <li><i>m</i> is the conformation count; and
  </li>
  <li><i>w<sub>k</sub></i> are the weights, or normalized
    population distribution.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Thus, <i>I<sub>i</sub></i>, <i>&delta;<sub>i</sub></i>, and
<i>J<sub>i</sub></i> are weighted averages over conformation values.
The result of the fitting is the optimal weights <i>w<sub>k</sub></i>.
</p>

<!--
<img src="spectralanalysis/conformer_calc_shift.png" class="center"
    alt="Calculate shift term" />
<img src="spectralanalysis/conformer_calc_dist.png" class="center"
    alt="Calculated distance term" />
<img src="spectralanalysis/conformer_calc_J.png" class="center"
    alt="Calculated J-coupling term" />

<p>In the foregoing, <i>exp</i> refers to the experimental measurements,
and <i>sim</i> refers to the simulated measurements made over <i>m</i>
conformers.  <i>n<sub>I</i>, <i>n<sub>&delta;</sub></i>, and
<i>n<sub>J</sub></i> are the number of shift, distance, and J-coupling
measurements, respectively.  <i>I<sub>sim,i</sub></i>,
<i>&delta;<sub>sim,i</sub></i>, and <i>J;<sub>sim,i</sub></i> are the
shift, distance, and J-coupling weighted averages, respectively, over
all <i>m</i> conformers for a particular measurement <i>i</i>.</p>

<p>The weights <i>w</i> must satisfy the following constraints, given
that they represent conformer proportions or probabilities:</p>

<img src="spectralanalysis/neq_1a.png" class="center"
    alt="Theory Constraints 1" />
<img src="spectralanalysis/neq_1b.png" class="center"
    alt="Theory Constraints 2" />
-->

<p>Note that each term in <b><i>F</i></b> is normalized by the variance
<i>&sigma;</i><sup>2</sup> of the respective measurement errors, which
are typically different for each type of measurement (<i>I</i>,
<i>&delta;</i>, <i>J</i>), and can also be different for each of the
<i>n</i> measurements of a given type.  The experimental measurement
error is used when available, otherwise, an estimated value is
applied.</p>


<h4>Data Requirements for Accuracy</h4>

<p>The Least Squares method used by the Conformer Distribution
application relies on non-degenerate measurement data that cover key
areas of the molecule under study, and on accurate error estimates.</p>

<ul>

<li>The calculated set of conformers used to perform the Least Squares
analysis should avoid including conformers with highly similar
measurement values, otherwise, degeneracy can result, in which multiple
possible optimal solutions present themselves, all very similar.  When
this happens, it becomes difficult to obtain a meaningful interpretation
of the results.</li>

<li>The calculated (<b>A<sup>T</sup></b>) and experimental (<b>b</b>)
values are normalized by the standard deviation of the measurement
errors.  Because this calculation is sensitive to the values of
<i>&sigma;</i>, an accurate estimate of the measurement error is vital
to obtaining an accurate computed conformer distribution.</li>


<li>The pairwise NOE values must cover the areas of interest on the
target molecule, and it is best to have as many input data
values as possible.  The addition of coupling constant or chemical shift
experimental results (or both) will increase the likelihood of arriving
at a correct solution.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Vibrational Analysis</h3>

<p>Forcefield and QM simulations yield the 3D atomic coordinates of a
conformer at its local energetic minimum, but the measurements obtained
from standard NOE experiments are in the form of intensity values
corresponding to the atomic vibrations of the molecule, time-averaged
over the timespan of the measurement.  NOE intensity peaks are a result
of pairwise interatomic interactions, and the peak height is
proportional to the internuclear atomic distance <i>r</i> of the atom
pair according to the following inverse exponential function:</p>

<img src="spectralanalysis/neq_vib_1.png" class="center"
    alt="Intensity is proportional to &lt;r&gt;^-6" />

<p>where the angle brackets represent a time-averaged quantity.</p>

<p>In simulations, although the average interatomic distance
&lt;<i>r</i>&gt; or mean-squared distance &lt;<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>&gt;
are readily calculable, the value of &lt;<i>r</i>&nbsp;<sup>-6</sup>&gt;
is generally unavailable.  Furthermore, attempting to approximate this
value, for example with &lt;<i>r</i>&gt;<sup>-6</sup>, can lead to large
inaccuracies, as, in general:</p>

<img src="spectralanalysis/neq_vib_2.png" class="center"
    alt="&lt;r^-6&gt; &gt; &lt;r&gt;^-6" />

<p>To make a meaningful comparison between calculated and experimental
results therefore requires simulating the effect of NOE time-averaging.
This is achieved by vibrational analysis, in which a sampling of the
normal modes of the molecule is performed.  A simulated value for
&lt;<i>r</i>&nbsp;<sup>-6</sup>&gt; can then be calculated from the
generated samples.  Normal modes are described in the next section.

<img src="spectralanalysis/normal_mode_sampling.png" class="center"
alt="Averaging Normal Modes"/>


<h4>Overview of Normal Modes</h4>

<p>The normal modes of a molecule are the independent vibrational
motions of that molecule.  Each normal mode can be approximated as a
simple harmonic oscillator, and can be assigned a coordinate that
follows the path of the vibrational motion.  The coordinate is expressed
in terms of changes to the positions of the atoms; in particular, the
<i>normal coordinate</i> <b>q</b> describes the displacement of an atom
from its equilibrium position.</p>

<p>Expressing the mass-weighted coordinate vector <b>q</b> in terms of
the matrix <b>M</b> of masses, where <i>m</i> is the mass of each atom,
the Cartesian position vector <i><b>x</b></i> of all atoms, and the
equilibrium position <i><b>x</b><sub>0</sub></i> of all atoms in their
potential well yields:</p>

<img src="spectralanalysis/neq_6a.png" class="center"
    alt="Mass-Weighted Coordinates 1" />
<img src="spectralanalysis/neq_6b.png" class="center"
    alt="Mass-Weighted Coordinates 2" />

<p>where <i>&delta;<sub>ij</sub></i> is the Kronecker delta.</p>

<p>The energy of a harmonic oscillator (in a local minimum) can be written
as:</p>

<img src="spectralanalysis/neq_7.png" class="center"
    alt="Harmonic Oscillator" />

<p>where <i>V</i> is the electrostatic potential, and the
mass-weighted force constraints matrix <b>H</b> is of dimensions <span
class="nobr">3<i>n</i> x 3<i>n</i></span>, where <i>n</i> is the number
of atoms.  Diagonalizing the system by a change of
coordinates to <i>&Chi;</i> space, defined below,
allows for restating the problem in terms of diagonal matrix
<b>L</b>, where the diagonal is formed of the eigenvalues
<i>&omega;<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup></i>,
<i>&omega;<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup></i>, ...
<i>&omega;<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup></i>,
and the matrix <b>A</b> of eigenvectors
<b>a</b><i><sub>i</sub></i>&nbsp;:</p>

<img src="spectralanalysis/neq_7b.png" class="center"
    alt="Eigenvector Matrix 1" />
<img src="spectralanalysis/neq_7c.png" class="center"
    alt="Eigenvector Matrix 2" />

<p><b><i>&Chi;</i></b> can be reformulated as a probability
distribution:</p>

<img src="spectralanalysis/neq_8.png" class="center"
    alt="Reformulated Distribution" />

<p>which is just a normal distribution with a mean of 0
and a standard deviation of:</p>

<img src="spectralanalysis/neq_9.png" class="center"
    alt="Gaussian Distribution" />

<p>and allows for a straightforward sampling procedure.</p>

<h4>Sampling the Normal Modes</h4>

<p>Sampling the vibrational space of a molecule is accomplished by
generating vectors <i><b>&Chi;<sub>&sigma;</sub></b></i> in the
diagonalized eigensystem, where each is a sample of the normal
distribution of a particular eigenmode with the corresponding standard
deviation <i>&sigma;</i>, as given by the equation above, multiplied by
the eigenvalue of that mode.</p>

<p>The final step is to convert back from the diagonalized system of
coordinates into the atomic Cartesian coordinate system:</p>

<img src="spectralanalysis/neq_10a.png" class="center"
    alt="Convert To Cartesians 1" />
<img src="spectralanalysis/neq_10b.png" class="center"
    alt="Convert To Cartesians 2" />
<img src="spectralanalysis/neq_10c.png" class="center"
    alt="Convert To Cartesians 3" />

where <i>&delta;<sub>ij</sub></i> is the Kronecker delta.

<!-- ==================== CONFORMER DISTRIBUTION EXAMPLE ================= -->

<a id="FITExamples"></a>
<h1>Conformer Distribution Examples</h1>

<p>
In this section we will present a number of examples of generating conformer
weights using the Conformer Distribution application.  Sample files are
contained in <tt>$MOE/sample/mol</tt>.
</p>

<div class="example">
<a id="pairDists"></a>
<h2>Macrocycle Pair Distances</h2>

<ol start="1">
<li><p><i>Create the starting macrocycle structure.</i></p>
<p>First, clear the system:</p>
<p class="indent_novspace"><span class="menu">RHS | Close</span></p>

<p>Open the macrocycle structure file:</p>
<p class="indent_novspace"><span class="menu">RHS | Open</span></p>
<p>In the Open panel, select <span class= "nobr">
<tt>$MOE/sample/mol/5N1Z_ligand.moe</tt></span> and press <b>OK</b>.</p>

<p>Check that the forcefield is set to <tt>Amber10:EHT</tt> and the
partial charges are fixed:
<p class="indent_novspace"><span class="menu">MOE | Footer | Potential Setup
</span></p>

<p>If the currently loaded forcefield is not Amber10:EHT, select it from
the <b>Load</b> menu.  The change is effected immediately.  Press
<span class="nobr"><b>Fix Charges</b></span> if the partial charges
require calculation.  Press <b>OK</b> to close the panel.</p>

<p>Minimize the structure:</p>
<p class="indent_novspace"><span class="menu">RHS | Minimize</span></p>
<p>This provides an unstrained input structure for Conformational Search.
</p>

<p>Save a local copy to disk:</p>
<p class="indent_novspace"><span class="menu">MOE | File | Save</span></p>
<p>In the Save panel, enter <tt>5N1Z_ligand_fixed.moe</tt> and press
<b>Save</b>.  This will be used for the remainder of this example.</p>
</li>

<li><p><i>Create a conformer database to analyze.</i></p>
<p>Start the Conformational Search application:</p>
<p class="indent_novspace"><span class="menu">
MOE | Compute | Conformations | Search</span></p>
<p>Change the <span class="nobr"><b>Output Database</b></span> to
<tt>5N1Z_conf.mdb</tt>.<br />
<br />
Press <b>OK</b> to start the search.  This should take a few minutes.
</p></li>

<li><p><i>Determine the conformer distribution.</i></p>
<p>Start the Conformer Distribution application:</p>
<p class="indent_novspace"><span class="menu">
DBV | Compute | Molecule | Spectral Analysis</span></p>
<p>The status display will show
<span class="nobr"><tt>Calculating NOE Intensities</tt></span>,
which will take a few seconds to complete.  This is calculated when the
database is opened the first time and uses the conformer geometries and
current forcefield as no QM-based hessian
information is present.  This adds an
<span class="nobr"><b>NOE_Intensity</b></span> column to the conformer
database.</p>

<p>Load the experimental information file for
<span class="nobr"><b>Pairwise Distances</b></span> by
pressing the <b>Browse</b> icon and entering
<span class="nobr"><tt>$MOE/sample/mol/5N1Z_dists.txt</tt></span> and
pressing <b>OK</b>.  Press <b>Calculate</b> to start the Conformer Plot.
This will take a few seconds to complete, with progress indicated in the
status display.  When complete, the Weight column in the Conformer List
can be sorted to show the dominant conformations.  The
Conformer Distribution panel should look something like this:

<img src="spectralanalysis/ex1_1.png" class="center"
    alt="Ex 1 Conformer Plot" />

The Conformer List reveals that there are only two relevant
conformations (the others are statistically insignificant).  Note that the
specific conformers returned by Conformer Search can change, so the specific
conformer numbers might not be reproduced.  The
<span class="nobr"><b>Select Results</b></span> Configuration option can
be changed to <span class="nobr"><b>Chi-square</b></span>, resulting
in a plot that looks something like this:

<img src="spectralanalysis/ex1_2.png" class="center"
    alt="Ex 1 Conformer Plot 2" />

</p></li>

<li><p><i>Create a subset plot.</i></p>
<p>The effect of varying weights of a conformer subset can be determined
by creating a subset plot. Using the Conformer list created above,
select the fourth and sixth conformers
when sorted by Weight. Click on the 6 conformers solution on the conformer plot.
This should align the vertical red line with the 6 on the x-axis. Switch the
<span class="nobr"><b>Mode of Operation</b></span> to <b>Subset</b> and
press the <b>Subset</b> button to create a 2-conformer subset using the
previously selected rows.  Press <b>Calculate</b> to start the calculation,
which will take a few seconds to complete.  This creates a Subset plot:

<img src="spectralanalysis/ex1_3.png" class="center"
    alt="Ex 1 Subset Plot" />

which shows the effect of varying the aggregate weight of these two
conformers from 0.0 to 1.0.
</p></li>

<li><p><i>Review conformer data.</i></p>
<p>The experimental and calculated data for individual conformers can be
easily reviewed.  Using the above example, the data for the first conformer
can be viewed by selecting it in the Conformer list and pressing
<img src="spectralanalysis/expt_icon.png" class="icon" />.  This brings
up the following list:

<img src="spectralanalysis/ex1_4.png" class="center"
    alt="Ex 1 Conformer 9 Data" />

which shows the individual pairwise distances as read from the experimental
data file.  This can be sorted by the <b>Diff</b> column to show the
distances where the calculated value greatly exceeds the experimental
data.  Selecting the first row (the distance between atoms with labels
<tt>47</tt> and <tt>60</tt>)
and pressing <b>Display</b> shows this
interaction in the MOE window, colored and labeled by the <b>Diff</b>
value:

<img src="spectralanalysis/ex1_5.png" class="center"
    alt="Ex 1 Conformer 9 Worst Fit" />

The line is drawn in <font color="green">green</font> because the difference
is within the (default) error value for pairwise distances.

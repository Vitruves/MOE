  <!-- ============================== OVERVIEW ============================= -->
<a id="Overview"></a>
<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>The Ligand Interactions application provides a means to visualize an
  active site of a complex in diagrammatic form. The content is presented in a
  concise and stylized manner, and summarizes a large amount of spatial data
  making use of mnemonic glyphs where appropriate. The panel can be used as a
  complement to 3D visualization, as the 2D and 3D representations can be
  displayed alongside one another. The content can also be exported in
  graphical or tabular form, as well as printed.</p>

<p>The diagram itself consists of the selected ligand as the centerpiece,
  which is drawn using the traditional schematic style for molecules. A
  selection of interacting entities, which includes hydrogen-bonded residues,
  close but non-bonded residues, solvent molecules and ions are drawn about the
  ligand, their positions in 2D being chosen to be representative of the
  observed 3D distances, as well as taking into account aesthetic
  considerations. Additional properties such as solvent accessible surface area
  and the ligand proximity outline are also shown.</p>

<p>The user interface provides control over whether certain elements are
  drawn, and to some extent their color and style. The definition of hydrogen
  bonded, ionic and proximity interactions can be affected by modifying cutoff
  values. The interactions which are shown in the 2D diagram in the panel are
  reflected also in the MOE main window.</p>

  <!-- ============================ METHODOLOGY ============================ -->
<a id="Method"></a>
<h1>Methodology</h1>

<p>The information content displayed in the Ligand Interactions panel is
  similar to that presented by the popular program <tt>LIGPLOT</tt> [Wallace
  1995], except with a stronger emphasis on aesthetics. A full treatment of the
  method is described in the literature [Clark 2007].</p>

<p>Generation of the protein-ligand annotation diagram consists of the
  following steps:</p>
  <div class="indent">
    <ol>
      <li>Ascertain the interactions between the ligand and the species
      immediately surrounding it, and decide which residues, solvents and ions
      are to be included in the diagram.</li>
      <li>Layout the coordinates of the ligand, taking into consideration the
      extent to which the flattened version is comparable to the 3D
      conformation.</li>
      <li>Position the residues with strong hydrogen bonds to the ligand,
      arranging them in the plane and reproducing the 3D distances in 2D as
      best as possible.</li>
      <li>Position the residues which are proximal to the ligand but do not
      have strong contacts, preserving 3D distances to the extent
      possible.</li>
      <li>Calculate the proximity contour and solvent accessibility.</li>
      <li>Draw each of the entities.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
<a id="MethodInteract"></a>
<h2>Calculate Interactions</h2>

<p>The atoms which constitute the ligand must first be decided upon. By
  default, this is the set of atoms which would be selected using <nobr><b>MOE
  | Select | Ligand</b></nobr>, further reduced by including only the largest
  continuously connected component. Other definitions of the ligand may be
  used, but the set must indicate a continuously connected molecular
  species.</p>

<p><b>Hydrogen Bonds</b>: Each pair of heavy atoms from the ligand set and
  the receptor set could be a hydrogen bond if: (1) there is a tautomer
  combination in which one of the atoms is a potential H-bond donor and the
  other is a potential H-bond acceptor, and (2) the distance and orientation
  are favorable for the particular functional group. For each viable
  ligand:receptor atom pair an interaction energy is calculated, and it is
  possible to set the minimum bound for what is considered to be hydrogen bond.
  The directionality of the hydrogen bond is also noted; it is possible for a
  ligand:receptor pair to be potentially both a donor <i>and</i> an
  acceptor.</p>

<p><b>Solvent Interactions</b>: Ligand atoms can form hydrogen bonds with
  solvent molecules, typically water. The perception and scoring is done in the
  same way as for ligand:receptor pairs, except that solvent hydrogen bonds are
  only retained if the solvent molecule has a qualifying hydrogen bond to the
  ligand. If the solvent molecule has additionally a hydrogen bond to the
  receptor it is drawn as well. Un-anchored solvent molecules are considered to
  be fluxional and transient, and do not appear in the diagram.</p>

<p><b>Metal Ligation</b>: Metal atoms which are bonded to the ligand, or are
  close enough to be within bonded distance, are classified as ligand:metal
  ligation interactions. As with hydrogen bonds, energies for the metal
  ligation interactions are calculated, which may be used as a minimum bound
  for inclusion.</p>

<p><b>Nonbonded Residues</b>: Residues which approach closely to the ligand
  but do not have any qualifying strong interactions (i.e. hydrogen bonds) may
  be classified as non-bonded residues that have a significant effect on the
  orientation and binding of the ligand, but which may be spread out over a
  number of pairwise contacts, each of which is relatively weak. Classification
  of nonbonded residues is done by the following simple formula:</p>
  <div align="center">
    <i>cutoff</i> = parameter (default 4.5 &Aring;)<br />
    <i>num</i> = number of heavy atoms in the residue closer than
    <i>cutoff</i><br />
    <i>limit</i> = <i>cutoff</i> - 0.9 + 0.1 * <i>num</i>
  </div>

<p>The residue must have at least one atom which approaches the ligand at a
  distance less than <i>limit</i> to qualify as having a nonbonded interaction.
  In this way, residues with few atoms which are particularly close, or many
  atoms which are quite close, are selected for inclusion in the diagram. They
  are not however assigned any kind of score, and are arranged much less
  rigorously than those with a specific strong interaction.</p>
<a id="MethodFlatten"></a>
<h2>Flattening Depiction</h2>

<p>The focal point of the 2D diagram produced by the Ligand Interactions tool
  is the ligand itself, which is arranged prior to placement of the residues
  with which it interacts. In order to produce an aesthetic layout, the MOE
  depiction layout algorithm is invoked [Clark 2006]. If called without
  modification, however, the standard depiction method would produce a 2D
  layout that maximizes dispersion between non-bonded atoms, within its set of
  constraints. This is not always an ideal starting point, since there is often
  a viable solution which does not maximize dispersion, but more closely
  reflects the original 3D conformation.</p>

<p>In order to encourage a 2D layout solution which suits the needs of the
  Ligand Interactions diagram, the layout engine is provided with a callback
  function which offsets the scores of each proposed layout with its own
  criteria. The modifications are crafted so that they are of sufficient
  magnitude to overwhelm the depiction layout algorithm's
  inverse-distance-squared repulsions between nonbonded atoms, but not large
  enough to force the depictor prematurely into its damage-control methods.</p>

<p>The score for each proposed depiction layout is modified like so:</p>
  <div align="center">
    <nobr>score = score + &Sigma;<sub>torsion</sub> w |&theta;<sub>3D</sub> -
    &theta;<sub>2D</sub>| + &Sigma;<sub>i,j</sub> w |dist3D<sub>ij</sub> -
    dist2D<sub>ij</sub>|</nobr>
  </div>

<p>The list of torsion quadruplets, and the original 3D angles, are
  determined before the process begins. In each case the 2D layout is penalized
  according to its relative deviation from the proper conformation, which
  rewards choices that resemble the original geometry.</p>

<p>Similarly, the distance matrix of heavy atom pairs [i,j] where i &lt; j is
  formed, and scaled such that the average bond length in 3D is the same as the
  2D depiction ideal. The 2D layout is penalized less if the distances are
  similar to the 3D conformation. The weighting for this term is set to the
  inverse square of the 3D distance, in order to prevent long range terms from
  overly dominating the score. For pairs where one of the atoms has a strong
  contact to a residue, the weighting is 10-times heavier, and those for which
  both atoms have a strong contact are magnified 100-fold.</p>
  <div align="center">
    <table class="noborder">
      <tr>
        <td colspan="2" align="center">
          <img src="prolig2d/flat1.png" />

<p class="caption">3D conformation of ligand</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td align="center" valign="bottom">
          <img src="prolig2d/flat2.png" />

<p class="caption">Normal depiction</p>
        </td>
        <td align="center" valign="bottom">
          <img src="prolig2d/flat3.png" />

<p class="caption">Flattening depiction</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

<p>It is important to note that the resulting depiction is not at all
  guaranteed to resemble the 3D conformation, but rather it is encouraged to do
  so, as long as primary aesthetic constraints can still be satisfied. Highly
  non-planar molecules (e.g. the orthogonal conformations of biphenyl
  derivatives) require compromise. The techniques which are described
  subsequently <i>desire</i> but do not <i>require</i> faithful correspondence
  with the 2D ligand coordinates and the proper original conformation.</p>
<a id="MethodPos1"></a>
<h2>Position Ligated Metals</h2>

<p>Metals which are classified as being ligated to the ligand are temporarily
  promoted to being a part of the ligand, immediately prior to the layout
  described above, then subsequently disconnected. This results in the position
  of the metal being obtained from the depiction layout.</p>
<a id="MethodPos2"></a>
<h2>Position Hydrogen-bonded Residues</h2>

<p>Residues and solvent molecules which are bound to the ligand by a hydrogen
  bond are placed next. There are many competing effects which determine where
  a strongly interacting residue is positioned. Since a line will be drawn on
  the final diagram for each such interaction, it is very important to try to
  find a position in which the 2D distances of these interactions
  proportionally reflects the 3D distance. But it is also important to provide
  an impression of the spatial relationship to other nearby residues, and to
  place them in such a way that they do not obscure other features such as
  bonds, atoms or other residues.</p>

<p><b>Initial placement</b>: Finding an initial guess position for each
  residue is very important, because the main placement criteria are expressed
  as a continuous multivariable optimization problem. Any starting point which
  is in a far-from-optimal local minimum must be avoided. As a general
  consideration, starting points should be far from atoms and bonds, and not
  inside rings, nor inside &quot;pincer&quot;-like formations.</p>

<p>In order to ensure that the basic requirements are met, a coarse grid is
  placed around the ligand, and the repulsions from specific regions are
  overlayed, as is shown in the following diagram:</p>
  <div align="center">
    <table class="noborder">
      <tr>
        <td><img src="prolig2d/grid1.png" style=
        "border: thin solid black;" /></td>
        <td><img src="prolig2d/grid2.png" style=
        "border: thin solid black;" /></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td align="center"><p class="caption">1. Base avoidance</p></td>
        <td align="center"><p class="caption">2. Specific attraction</p></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

<p>The base repulsive grid (1) is formed by adding Gaussian distributions at
  atom and ring centers, which ensure that the minimum point will be well
  outside of the molecular region. The grid in (2) shows the placement guide
  for a residue that has a single strong contact to the nitrogen atom which is
  highlighted with a circle. The overlay function is <nobr>[1 - d / max
  d]</nobr>, where d = distance between grid point and contacting atom. The
  grid point with the lowest value is shown by the X mark, and serves as the
  starting position for the residue.</p>

<p><b>Multivariable Refinement</b>: Each residue atom which has a strong
  contact to the ligand is placed in the method described above. Then, each of
  the (x,y) coordinates is defined as a variable, and they are collectively
  refined by minimization of the following continuously differentiable energy
  function:</p>
  <div align="center">
    <table class="noborder">
      <tr>
        <td>energy</td>
        <td>= &Sigma;<sub>ij</sub> w<sub>ij</sub>
        (dist<sup>2</sup><sub>ij</sub> - D<sup>2</sup>)<sup>2</sup></td>
        <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>(variable-variable desired
        distances)</i></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td>+ &Sigma;<sub>ij</sub> w<sub>ij</sub> exp [-K
        dist<sup>2</sup><sub>ij</sub>]</td>
        <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>(variable-variable short range
        repulsion)</i></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td>+ &Sigma;<sub>ik</sub> w<sub>ik</sub>
        (dist<sup>2</sup><sub>ik</sub> - D<sup>2</sup>)<sup>2</sup></td>
        <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>(variable-fixed point desired
        distances)</i></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td>+ &Sigma;<sub>ik</sub> w<sub>ik</sub> exp [-K
        dist<sup>2</sup><sub>ik</sub>]</td>
        <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>(variable-fixed point short range
        repulsion)</i></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td>+ &Sigma;<sub>&theta;</sub> w<sub>&theta;</sub> exp [-&frac12;K (1
        - cos &theta;)<sup>2</sup>]</td>
        <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>(variable-fixed point angular
        repulsion)</i></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

<p>The variable-variable terms are primarily based on the desired distance,
  which is that of the 3D environment of the receptor, which should be matched
  in 2D when possible. Since the term is distance to the power of 4, the
  weighting is scaled down by the 3D distance, in order to ensure that nearby
  residues influence each other more significantly. Short-range repulsion
  between variable terms are expressed as a Gaussian type function, which is
  scaled such that it dominates in the region of &lt;1 &Aring;, but fades
  quickly with greater distance.</p>

<p>Variable-fixed point desired distances are composed of the strong
  interactions to the ligand atoms. All ligand:receptor atom pairs which are
  not connected by a strong interaction are accumulated in the variable-fixed
  point repulsion terms.</p>

<p>Variable-fixed point angular repulsion terms appear when more than one
  receptor atom is connected to a single ligand atom, in which case the angle
  formed between each instance of <nobr>&theta =
  var<sub>i</sub>-fixed-var<sub>j</sub></nobr> is highly repulsive when &theta;
  is small.</p>

<p><b>Consolidation</b>: The atoms belonging to particular residues are
  collapsed into one point per residue by averaging positions. The energy
  function is updated accordingly with the interactions and distances merged,
  and the new variables are resubmitted to the energy minimization, to obtain
  final positions for the strongly-bound residues.</p>
<a id="MethodPos3"></a>
<h2>Position Non-bonded Residues</h2>

<p>Nonbonded residues are subjected to the same initial placement algorithm
  described above, except that the already-placed residues are also included in
  the regions of the surface to avoid. The same energy minimization process is
  used, except that the terms are employed differently. The variable-variable
  desired distance terms are not used. The variable-fixed point desired
  distances are set to be the initial placement positions, with a very light
  weighting. Variable-fixed point repulsion terms include ligand atoms, as well
  as the positions of residues which have previously been placed, and there is
  no angular repulsion term.</p>

<p>The overall effect is that the nonbonded residues are more sensitive to
  the initial placement algorithm, which is relative to all of the ligand atoms
  within a mild proximity of each residue, but are also more flexible in terms
  of deviation therefrom. They tend to be spaced evenly, and take up space
  beyond or in between the previously placed entities.</p>
  <div align="center">
    <table class="noborder">
      <tr>
        <td><img src="prolig2d/moesite.png" /></td>
        <td><img src="prolig2d/placemnt.jpg" /></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td align="center"><p class="caption">3D Active Site</p></td>
        <td align="center"><p class="caption">2D Placement</p></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

<p>The above images show a portion of the 3D active site of a protein-ligand
  complex, including for clarity only the residues and water molecules which
  are connected to the ligand by a hydrogen bond. It can be seen that the 2D
  arrangement shows the same orientation.</p>
<a id="MethodSurf"></a>
<h2>Proximity and Surfaces</h2>

<p>While the arrangement of ligands and residues is frequently sufficient to
  gain an insight into the proximity of the species in the active site, the
  information content can be significantly enhanced by calculating properties
  based on the 3D data, then presenting this data in a pictorial summary
  form.</p>

<p><b>Proximity Contour</b>: It useful to be able to observe how much space
  is available to the more outward-facing parts of the ligand, which can be
  expressed in its final form as a contour line surrounding the ligand. In
  areas where the exterior of the ligand is close to the receptor cavity, the
  line will be drawn tightly around the ligand in 2D, and loosely when there is
  plenty of available space.</p>

<p>In order to calculate the data for the contour, for each atom some number
  of trajectories (possibly zero) are generated. The trajectories are dependent
  on the geometry of the atom and the number of substituents. If there are
  insufficient anchor points, as is the case for sp<sup>3</sup> and
  sp<sup>2</sup> atoms with only one neighbor, a sampling set is created.
  Otherwise, the trajectories are indicative of the positions that would
  typically be occupied by a hydrogen substituent:</p>
  <div align="center">
    <table class="noborder">
      <tr>
        <td><img src="prolig2d/cannon1.png" class="icon"/></td>
        <td><img src="prolig2d/cannon2.png" class="icon"/></td>
        <td><img src="prolig2d/cannon3.png" class="icon"/></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><p class="caption">sp<sup>3</sup>/3</p></td>
        <td><p class="caption">sp<sup>3</sup>/2</p></td>
        <td><p class="caption">sp<sup>3</sup>/1</p></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><img src="prolig2d/cannon4.png" class="icon" /></td>
        <td><img src="prolig2d/cannon5.png" class="icon" /></td>
        <td><img src="prolig2d/cannon6.png" class="icon" /></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><p class="caption">sp<sup>2</sup>/2</p></td>
        <td><p class="caption">sp<sup>2</sup>/1</p></td>
        <td><p class="caption">sp/1</p></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

<p>For each of the trajectories, a &quot;cannonball&quot; of radius 0.8
  &Aring; is fired along the line. Every other atom in the system, except the
  origin, is considered to be a ball of van der Waals size. The extent is the
  distance which the cannonball travels before intersecting with another atom,
  bounded below by zero and above by 1.5 &Aring;. If multiple trajectories are
  assigned to the atom, the average is used.</p>

<p>The contour that is plotted from the resulting extents is useful as a
  measure of substitution space. For example, if by examining the diagram it
  appears that there is room for a methyl group, this is likely to be the case
  in the actual active site:</p>
  <div align="center">
    <img src="prolig2d/contour.jpg" />
    <p class="caption">Proximity contour: 1RO6 Hydrolase</p>
  </div>

<p>In the above complex, it can clearly be seen that there is a significant
  amount of space available for direct substitution on any of the three ring
  systems, especially the terminal cyclopentyl group, but that the heteroatoms
  and one side of the aromatic ring are more congested.</p>

<p><b>Solvent Accessibility</b>: Two types of solvent accessibility metrics
  are available: ligand solvent accessibility, and residue solvent
  accessibility. Both of these quantities are based on measuring exposed
  surface area once each of the atoms has been assigned a van der Waals-like
  radius + 1.4 &Aring;, the latter part assuming that the solvent is water.
  Qualitatively, this means that if an atom's assigned sphere is completely
  subsumed by the spheres of other atoms in the ensemble, its exposure is 0. If
  an atom exists alone in space with no overlap, its exposure is
  4&pi;r<sup>2</sup>. Deeply buried atoms tend to have almost zero exposed
  surface area, whereas for instance a terminal substituent on a ligand which
  is sticking out of the active site may have an exposed surface area on the
  order of half the maximum possible value.</p>

<p>For solvent accessibility of ligands, the surface accessibility
  calculation is carried out on the ligand + receptor complex, i.e. the
  receptor residues will also cover up the surfaces of the ligand atoms, if
  they are close enough. In the following example, the oligopeptide ligand is
  oriented &quot;through&quot; the active site, like an embedded arrow:</p>
  <div align="center">
    <img src="prolig2d/ligsurf.jpg" />
    <p class="caption">Ligand solvent accessibility: 1AAQ Hydrolase</p>
  </div>

<p>The part of the ligand which is shown on the right hand side of the
  diagram projects significantly far from the active site, and two of the
  terminal methyl groups are very highly exposed to solvent. The opposite end
  of the ligand, shown on the left hand side, is also exposed, but to a lesser
  extent.</p>

<p>Solvent exposure of receptor residues is calculated by examining the
  difference between the solvent-exposed surface area of the receptor with and
  without the presence of the ligand. The differences are summed for the heavy
  atoms belonging to each residue. If the value is zero, then the residue
  exposure to solvent is not affected at all by the ligand. A high value
  probably means that a number of residue atoms are &quot;covered up&quot; by
  the ligand, which is often indicative of hydrophobic interactions which are
  collectively important. A small value likely means that just one or two of
  the residue atoms are moderately affected by the presence of the ligand.</p>

<p>In the following example:</p>
  <div align="center">
    <img src="prolig2d/recsurf.png" />
    <p class="caption">Receptor solvent accessibility: 1AAQ Hydrolase</p>
  </div>

<p>The receptor exposure differences are shown by the size and intensity of
  the turquoise discs surrounding the residues. The Arg<i>A</i>8 and
  Gly<i>B</i>48 residues (on the right hand side) express a side-chain and
  backbone segment, respectively, which are both very highly exposed to solvent
  in the active site when the ligand is absent. The presence of the ligand
  greatly reduces the solvent accessible surface area.</p>
<a id="MethodDraw"></a>
<h2>Drawing</h2>

<p>The Ligand Interactions panel calculates the desired properties using the
  contents of the MOE molecular system for input, modified by user-specified
  parameters. This data is then used to prepare a 2D <a href=
  "../svl/fcnref/grfcn.htm">graphics object</a>, in conjunction with
  user-specified aesthetic preferences. The graphics object is used to display
  the contents in the panel, and also for printing and exporting.</p>
<a id="MethodConcur"></a>
<h2>Concurrent Layout</h2>

<p>Ligand Interactions operates differently when the input is specified as a
  series of bound complexes, rather than a single instance in isolation.
  Depending on the combination of options selected, the following additional
  circumstances apply:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>The flattened ligands are co-aligned on a common manifold, so their
      relative orientations are preserved;</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>The residues are placed simultaneously around all of the ligands, so a
      single layout is found which suits all of the complexes;</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>The diagrams are labeled with additional annotations depending on the
      extent to which various properties are conserved.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

<p>The following example shows a single protein, to which two docked poses of
  a single ligand have been selected:</p>
<img src="prolig2d/concur1.jpg" class="center" />
<img src="prolig2d/concur2.jpg" class="center" />

<p>The two poses are oriented in an opposite way, and this observation is
  reflected in the 2D diagram. The residue positions are identical in both
  cases. In the first diagram there is a hydrogen bond to residue B35, which is
  annotated with a bar behind the directional arrow to show that the
  interaction is not conserved throughout the series. In the second diagram,
  the hydrogen bond does not exist, so the interaction is shown as
  &quot;dangling&quot;.
  <!-- ============================ APPLICATION ============================ --></p>
<a id="Run"></a>
<h1>Running the Application</h1>

<p>To use the Ligand Interactions panel, load a ligand-receptor complex into
  MOE and then select <span class="nobr"><b>MOE | Compute | Ligand
  Interactions</b></span> or <span class="nobr"><b>MOE | RHS | Ligand | Ligand
  Interactions</b></span>. The panel will open, displaying a 2D depiction of
  the ligand and its interactions with proximal residues of the protein. If the
  contents of the molecular system change while the panel is up, press
  <b>Apply</b> to recalculate the interaction data and update the
  depiction.</p>

<p>In the panel below, the ligand-receptor interactions for the complex found
  in the file <nobr><tt>$MOE/sample/mol/1RO6.moe</tt></nobr> are shown.</p>

  <img src="prolig2d/panel.png" class="center" />

<p>For most ligand/protein complexes, the default settings used to produce
  the diagram should be reasonable.</p>

<table class="noborder">
  <tr>
    <td><b>Receptor</b></td>
    <td>By default, the set of atoms with which the ligand may
    potentially interact is the union of the atoms which would be selected by
    <nobr><b>MOE | Select | Receptor</b></nobr> and by <nobr><b>MOE | Select
    | Solvent</b></nobr>. The receptor atoms can be changed to another set
    definition if necessary. Pressing the <b>?</b> button shows which atoms
    are included in the currently indicated set.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Ligand</b></td>
    <td>The default ligand atoms are those which would be
    selected by <nobr><b>MOE | Select | Ligand</b></nobr>. Because the 2D
    diagram only includes one connected component, it is often necessary to
    provide more specific information if there are multiple disconnected
    species which are considered to be ligands. The simplest way to
    accomplish this is to select only the desired ligand, and change the
    value of the option widget to <nobr><tt>Selected Atoms</tt></nobr>. To
    check which atoms are included in the current set, click on the <b>?</b>
    button.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>... series</b></td>
    <td>
      Special circumstances arise when the MOE main window contains what are
      clearly indicated as multiple ligands, and one or more receptors.
      Instead of the default selection for the <b>Receptor</b> and
      <b>Ligand</b> fields, the content will look more like:
      <img src="prolig2d/complex.png" class="center" />

<p>Whenever the ligand+receptor pairs begin with the same complex
      number, the diagram which is generated uses the concurrent layout
      method. Also, the up and down buttons which appear to the right of the
      input selection allow for a quick and convenient way to step through
      the series of complexes. If the checkbox <b>Auto-Isolate</b> is on,
      the active site is rendered during browsing as if the
      <b>Isolate</b> button in the footer is pressed each time.

  <tr>
    <td><b>Options</b></td>
    <td>
      The <b>Options</b> pager controls the contents of the panel below it,
      which initially shows the <b>Legend</b> contents. Other pages present a
      variety of modifications which can be made to the way the ligand
      interaction data is calculated and presented.

<p><b>Legend</b>: A graphical key to help interpret the 2D part of the
      Ligand Interactions panel is given. The legend changes to reflect the
      currently selected aesthetic annotation preferences.</p>
      <img src="prolig2d/option1.png" class="center" />

<p><b>2D Contact Style</b>: The manner in which the contacts are drawn
      in 2D can be controlled using this page. Hydrogen bonds between the
      ligand and the receptor are subdivided into bonds to the residue
      <b>Backbone</b> or the <b>Sidechain</b>. Interactions between the
      ligand and the <b>Solvent</b> are drawn distinctly. <b>Ionic</b>
      interactions include metals which were found to be chelated, or were
      bonded to the ligand in the original structure. In cases where the
      ligand is covalently bound to the protein, the severed bond which
      demarcates the link between the two is drawn using the same style
      policy as is used for ionic bonds.</p>
      <img src="prolig2d/option3.png" class="center" />

<p>Line style options include None, Dot, Dash and Solid, and arbitrary
      colors may be chosen. When the <b>Distance</b> box is checked, the
      interaction types will be annotated by the distance between the two
      heavy atoms, in angstroms. When the <b>Energy</b> box is selected, the
      interaction energy is shown in kcal/mol.</p>

<p><b>2D Residue Colors</b>: Residue colors can be changed for the 2D
      diagram. The color of the residue specifically refers to the color with
      which the circle is filled, and any further annotation. By default, all
      types of residues are set to Auto.</p>
      <img src="prolig2d/option4.png" class="center" />

<p>The residues occurring in the diagram are one of four types,
      respectively: <b>H-bonded</b> refers to residues with hydrogen bonds to
      the ligand. <b>Metal</b> refers to metals which are close enough to be
      included in the diagram, though not actually bonded (very tightly bound
      metals are treated specially, and drawn as part of the ligand).
      <b>Solvent</b> refers to solvent molecules, usually water, hydrogen
      bonded to the ligand. <b>Nonbonded</b> refers to receptor residues
      which are close to but do not have a hydrogen bond to the ligand.</p>

<p>The possible coloring schemes for each of the residue types are
      Auto, User, Residue, Chain and None. The meaning of Auto depends on the
      residue type. For receptor residues, whether they are bonded or not,
      the main color is light green if the residue is &quot;greasy&quot;
      (i.e. does not have a polar or charged sidechain), or light mauve
      otherwise. Furthermore if the side chain is basic, the residue is
      annotated with a blue ring; if it is acidic, it receives a red ring.
      Solvent residues of type Auto are drawn with no interior fill, and
      metal residues are colored gray.</p>

<p>Types User, Residue, Chain and None are interpreted in the same way
      regardless of the residue type. When User is selected, a Color-chooser
      widget appears, allowing the specific color to be selected. Residue and
      Chain cause the residue to be colored according to the corresponding
      color of the MOE object. Note that the default color for residues is
      black, which is translated into transparent in this case. Selecting
      None makes the residue transparent, i.e. it is drawn with only a border
      and text.</p>

<p><b>Diagram Annotations</b>: Additional annotations in the 2D diagram can
      be enabled or disabled.</p>
    <img src="prolig2d/option5.png" class="center" />
      <ul>
        <li><b>Proximity Contour</b> refers to the dotted outline that
        surrounds the ligand, denoting distance to the active site
        interior.</li>
        <li><b>Ligand Solvent Exposure</b> refers to the blue smudges that
        are drawn behind some of the ligand atoms, to denote extent of
        solvent exposure.</li>
        <li><b>Receptor Solvent Exposure</b> refers to the turquoise discs
        that are drawn behind some of the residues, to denote the difference
        in solvent exposure due to the presence of the ligand.</li>
        <li><b>Inter-residue Contacts</b> allows hydrogen bonds and
        non-peptidic covalent bonds between receptor residues to be
        annotated.</li>
        <li><b>Bound Solvent Contacts</b> causes residues which interact with
        non-labile solvent molecules to be included in the diagram if they
        were otherwise insufficiently proximal.</li>
        <li><b>Arene System Contacts</b> causes &pi;-&pi;, &pi;-H and
        &pi;-cation interactions to be annotated.</li>
        <li><b>Union of Receptor Residues</b> insists that for a series of
        complexes, any residue which qualifies for inclusion in any diagram
        is included in all diagrams.</li>
        <li><b>Fixed Receptor Positions</b> causes concurrent receptor
        optimization for a series; if not on, then the ligands will be
        co-aligned, but the receptors will arrange themselves separately for
        each diagram.</li>
        <li><b>Conserved Features</b> causes additional annotations to be
        added to a series to show any interactions which are only observed in
        some cases, as well as for residues which do not have the same amino
        acid type throughout the series.</li>
        <li><b>Site Wall Clash</b> enables checking for ligand atoms which
        approach receptor atoms too closely. Cases where such heavy atoms are
        closer than 1.2 &Aring; less than the sum of the van der Waals
        distances are marked as clashing atoms. If clashing atoms disconnect
        the ligand into multiple components, then all but the largest
        component is also categorized as clashing. Clashing atoms are drawn
        in red, and all interactions with the receptor are invalidated.</li>
      </ul>

<p><b>Rendering</b>: Several miscellaneous style preferences
      can be set within this option:</p>
      <img src="prolig2d/option6.png" class="center" />

<p><b>Rotation</b> allows the diagram to be rotated by the given angle.
      If <b>Reflection</b> is checked, then the diagram is reflected across
      the X-axis prior to being rotated. If <b>Match 3D View</b> is enabled,
      the output diagram will be aligned to match the 3D coordinates on the
      screen (press <b>Apply</b> to update the diagram after the 3D
      orientation was changed).
      The <b>Ligand font</b> size of the heteroatom labels as well as whether
      they are colored by element colors can be specified.
      <b>Residue Size</b> allows the
      amount of space taken up by the cartoonish residue labels to be
      modified from the default setting. <b>Single Letter Residues</b> allows
      the single letter residue codes to be used instead of the default 3
      letter codes.</p>

<p><b>Parameters</b>: The criteria for the various types of contacts
      can be controlled on this page. The <b>H-bond</b>, and <b>Ionic</b>
      values refer to the minimum interactions energies (in kcal/mol)
      required in order to qualify. Note that residues which possess a
      hydrogen bond or ionic metal bond to the ligand that does not meet the
      cutoff will most likely be reclassified as nonbonded residues, and
      still be represented in the diagram. Solvent residues which do not
      qualify for a sufficiently strong hydrogen bond generally do not
      feature in the diagram.</p>

<p>The <b>Cutoff</b> distance refers to the distance which a residue
      atom must be within in order to activate the calculation for deciding
      whether or not the whole residue meets the criteria, as described
      <a href="#MethodPos3">previously</a>.</p>

<h2>Example 1: Biotin and receptor</h2>

<p>Start by loading the example biotin complex, and setup a surface in
    order to view the active site in 3D:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Clear the molecular data in MOE with <nobr><b>MOE | File |

      </li>
      <li><p>Load biotin with <nobr><b>MOE | File | Open</b></nobr> and select

        Surfaces and Maps | Molecular Surface...</b></nobr>. Without changing
        any of the default options, press the <b>Isolate</b> button, followed
        by <b>Create</b>.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Adjust the transparency to suit, using the material widget <img src=
        "prolig2d/material.png" alt="material" class="icon" />.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Orient and zoom the system so that the groove of the active site is
        clearly visible, such as in the image shown below:</p>
       <img src="prolig2d/ex1a.jpg" alt=
        "example 1a" class="center" />
      </li>
    </ol>

<p>To view the active site in schematic form:</p>
    <ol start="6">
      <li><p>Open the Ligand Interactions panel with <nobr><b>MOE | Compute |
        Ligand Interactions</b></nobr>. The diagram shown in the main panel
        should resemble the following:</p>
        <img src="prolig2d/ex1b.png" alt="example 1b" class="center" />
      </li>
    </ol>

<p>The conformational similarity between the 2D and 3D layout of the ligand
    can be seen in the images shown above. Further examination of the two
    renditions shows that the placements of the H-bonded residues Asn49, Ser45
    and Asp128 are qualitatively preserved. The three residues which are
    H-bonded to the urea carbonyl atom (Ser27, Tyr43, Asn23) in a triad cannot
    be shown in the same way as per the 3D source, but the selected orientation
    is a reasonable compromise.</p>

<p>Some impression of the hydrophobic region around the alkyl chain in the
    center of the biotin molecule is given by the proximity of
    &quot;greasy&quot; residues, which are colored light green. The polar ends
    of biotin are more closely affiliated with polar or ionic residues, both
    H-bonded and not. The proximity contour shows that the urea functional
    group is very closely hemmed-in by the active site. The remainder of the
    molecule enjoys relatively spacious conditions, yet despite there being a
    significant distance between the boundary of the active site and the carbon
    atoms of the alkyl connector segment, this region has a very low solvent
    accessible surface area.</p>

    </ol>

<p>This particular protein has a covalently bound ligand. Because there is
    some ambiguity as to the definition of the ligand, it is necessary for the
    user to specify which it is. In the diagram shown above, the covalent
    attachment point is Ser195. The covalent bond which was detached from the
    ligand is drawn using a thick black line in the above diagram. In the 3D
    structure, Ser195 has a backbone hydrogen bonding interaction to the
    connected carbonyl group, which forms a 6-membered ring.</p>

<p>The covalent ligand has few strong interactions with the remainder of
    the protein. The steroid end of the ligand (right) projects far out of the
    active site, as is indicated by the loosening contour, and the high solvent
    exposure of the terminal atoms.</p>

<h2>Example 3: 1ATP Phosphotransferase</h2>

<p>The diagram contains many points, as the ligand is large and ripe with
    interactions, including hydrogen bonds to sidechain and backbone residues,
    hydrogen bonds to solvent molecules, and two chelated metal ions. The
    encapsulating 3D nature of this interaction site cannot be fully captured
    in the flattened representation, but a reasonable indication of the
    conformation, and an enumeration of all the interactions are clearly
    presented.</p>

<p>Note that this particular protein is composed of two strands, both of
    which have contacts with the ligand. As shown on the diagram, the residue
    ID numbers are prefixed by <i>A</i> or <i>B</i> to denote the parent chain.
    Because the raw PDB data file was used, there are no hydrogen atoms in the
    structure, and they are not used or shown in the diagram aside from a few
    implicit ones.</p>

<h2>Example 4: Aligned Series</h2>

<p>An aligned series of complexes can be used to view a collection of
    crystal structures which have been superposed in 3D, even if they do not
    have completely identical residues. The PDB codes 2EUF, 2F2C and 1CKP are
    shown below:</p>

    <img src="prolig2d/ex4b.png" class="center" />
    <img src="prolig2d/ex4c.png" class="center" />

<p>The first two complexes are CDK2 inhibitors, the last is a CDK6
    inhibitor. The ligands are overlaid in 2D in order to convey their relative
    binding modes, and the residues are laid out in the same way for all of the
    diagrams. Residues which are not consistently the same amino acid type
    throughout are marked with curved sidebars on the interior, whereas those
    which are invariant are drawn normally. Non-conserved interactions, in this
    case all of them, are drawn with a line behind the arrowhead, while missing
    interactions are drawn with a line to an &quot;X&quot;.</p>
